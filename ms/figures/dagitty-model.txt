Table 2 Fallacy: Coefficient of plantation age can be interpreted as (unconfounded) total effects on wildling abundance. None of the covariates in the model mediate its effects. Other covariates (climate, relative elevation) cannot be interpreted as total effect on wildling abundance. See http://www.dagitty.net/learn/graphs/table2-fallacy.html
