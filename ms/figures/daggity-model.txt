Minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating the total effect of ecosystem type on wildlings:

    climate, locality, proximity to plantation, relative elevation
    climate, locality, relative elevation, seed deposition density

Table 2 Fallacy: Coefficient of plantation age can be interpreted as (unconfounded) total effects on wildlings. None of the covariates in the model mediate its effects. Other covariates (climate, relative elevation) cannot be interpreted as total effect on wildlings. See http://www.dagitty.net/learn/graphs/table2-fallacy.html
