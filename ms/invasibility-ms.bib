  abstract = {1 In many places in Europe, trees are currently far below their theoretical altitudinal limit because of past land use. However, under the current crisis affecting mountain agriculture, trees are likely to recolonize the subalpine belt. Addressing the societal issues associated with such landscape change requires predictive tools to assess vegetation dynamics in relation to management strategies. This study aims to analyse the factors determining tree dynamics at the subalpine ecotone and to evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape vegetation patterns. 2 We developed a hierarchical scaling approach and applied it to a European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) colonization in the French Alps. Our landscape case study focused on subalpine south-facing grasslands of Villar d’Arêne (France). First, we used a habitat-suitability model to delineate the climatic suitability habitats of larch in the French Alps. Then we used a landscape model (LaMoS) to determine whether larch is able to colonize these grasslands predicted to be climatically suitable, considering land use and local vegetation. The sensitivity of landscape colonization patterns to land-use scenarios (abandonment, delayed mowing or traditional mowing) and biological attributes of larch were analysed with a factorial simulation experiment. 3 The accuracy of the habitat-suitability model at the French Alps scale allowed for the prediction that the grasslands of Villar d’Arêne were highly suitable for larch. 4 Simulations highlighted the effect of land use on larch establishment at the local but not at the landscape scale. On the other hand, larch attributes such as dispersal capacity, juvenile tolerance to light interaction (competition and facilitation) and its capacity to survive on infertile soil were shown as essential for tree spatial dynamics. 5 Synthesis and applications. Combining a habitat-suitability model with a spatially and temporally explicit landscape model enhances the capacity to account for environmental factors acting at different overlapping scales. This modelling strategy increases the robustness and accuracy of predictions, a prerequisite for landscape management in a global change context. We conclude that ongoing and future agri-environmental policies have to be quickly adapted to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by subalpine grasslands.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are often interested in answering causal questions from observational data but generally lack the training to appropriately infer causation. When applying statistical analysis (e.g., generalized linear model) on observational data, common statistical adjustments can often lead to biased estimates between variables of interest due to processes such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias. To overcome these limitations, we present an overview of structural causal modeling (SCM), an emerging causal inference framework that can be used to determine cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The SCM framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visualize researchers' assumptions about the causal structure of a system or process under study. Following this, a DAG-based graphical rule known as the backdoor criterion can be applied to determine statistical adjustments (or lack thereof) required to determine causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of unobserved confounding variables, an additional rule called the frontdoor criterion can be employed to determine causal effects. Here, we use simulated ecological examples to review how the backdoor and frontdoor criteria can return accurate causal estimates between variables of interest, as well as how biases can arise when these criteria are not used. We further provide an overview of studies that have applied the SCM framework in ecology. SCM, along with its application of DAGs, has been widely used in other disciplines to make valid causal inferences from observational data. Their use in ecology holds tremendous potential for quantifying causal relationships and investigating a range of ecological questions without randomized experiments.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess the scale of variation for major environmental gradients in Norway. To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and land-cover types. Location The mainland of Norway. Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain size) of 1 × 1, 5 × 5 and 10 × 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of these. Results The first four principal components explained between 75\% and 85\% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance: (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4) topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1–3). The first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions: vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine). Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of bioclimatic regional vegetation variation in Norway, provide an explicit characterization of this variation in terms of climatic variables, and show that environmental variability can be reproduced as GIS layers in step-less models. These models have the potential to become important tools for future predictive modelling within resource management, conservation planning and biogeographical (and other ecological) research.},

However, country-specific risk assessment methods may lead to different results for the same NNT between countries of comparable growth conditions, raising doubts about the reliability of risk classifications. Here, we analysed six risk assessment tools used in Germany and adjacent countries for their practical applicability and consistency using four NNT (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh., Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb. ex Murray), Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Quercus rubra L.) as case studies. Using these tools to classify risks for the same NNT and reference area (Germany) yielded inconsistent results for all NNT. The reasons for this were (1) differences in classification and weighting of criteria, (2) a lack of data to quantify invasion risks and (3) uncertainties related to assessment methodologies. Moreover, the tools fail to distinguish between risks posed by NNT in different sites. We suggest that instead the risks should be assessed for different ecosystem types by using site-specific inventory data covering the establishment, spread and potential impact of NNT. Our recommendations provide a foundation for developing a consistent, systematic Pan-European approach to assess invasiveness while addressing both risk and forest management aspects.},

  abstract = {Non-­native tree species (NNT) are used in European forestry for many purposes including their growth performance, valuable timber, and resistance to drought and pest or pathogen damage. Yet, cultivating NNT may pose risks to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provisioning of ecosystem services, and several NNT have been classified as invasive in Europe. Typically, such classifications are based on risk assessments, which do not adequately consider site-­specific variations in impacts of the NNT or the extent of affected areas. Here, we present a new methodological framework that facilitates both mitigating risks associated with NNT and taking advantage of their ecosystem services. The framework is based on a stratified assessment of risks posed by NNT which distinguishes between different sites and considers effectiveness of available management strategies to control negative effects. The method can be applied to NNT that already occur in a given area or those NNT that may establish in future. The framework consists of eight steps and is partly based on existing knowledge. If adequate site-­specific knowledge on NNT does not yet exist, new evidence on the risks should be obtained, for example, by collecting and analyzing monitoring data or modeling the potential distribution of NNT. However, limitations remain in the application of this method, and we propose several policy and management recommendations which are required to improve the responsible use of NNT.},

  abstract = {Zeros (i.e. events that do not happen) are the source of two common phenomena in count data: overdispersion and zero-inflation. Zeros have multiple origins in a dataset: false zeros occur due to errors in the experimental design or the observer; structural zeros are related to the ecological or evolutionary restrictions of the system under study; and random zeros are the result of the sampling variability. Identifying the type of zeros and their relation with overdispersion and/or zero inflation is key to select the most appropriate statistical model. Here we review the different modelling options in relation to the presence of overdispersion and zero inflation, tested through the dispersion and zero inflation indices. We then examine the theory of the zero-inflated (ZI) models and the use of the score tests to assess overdispersion and zero inflation over a model. In order to choose an adequate model when analysing count data we suggest the following protocol: Step 1) classify the zeros and minimize the presence of false zeros; Step 2) identify suitable covariates; Step 3) test the data for overdispersion and zero-inflation and Step 4) choose the most adequate model based on the results of step 3 and use score tests to determine whether more complex models should be implemented. We applied the recommended protocol on a real dataset on plant–herbivore interactions to evaluate the suitability of six different models (Poisson, NB and their zero-inflated versions—ZIP, ZINB). Our data were overdispersed and zero-inflated, and the ZINB was the model with the best fit, as predicted. Ignoring overdispersion and/or zero inflation during data analyses caused biased estimates of the statistical parameters and serious errors in the interpretation of the results. Our results are a clear example on how the conclusions of an ecological hypothesis can change depending on the model applied. Understanding how zeros arise in count data, for example identifying the potential sources of structural zeros, is essential to select the best statistical design. A good model not only fits the data correctly but also takes into account the idiosyncrasies of the biological system.},

  abstract = {As a carbon dioxide removal measure, the Norwegian government is currently considering a policy of large-scale planting of spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst) on lands in various states of natural transition to a forest dominated by deciduous broadleaved tree species. Given the aspiration to bring emissions on balance with removals in the latter half of the 21st century in effort to limit the global mean temperature rise to “well below” 2°C, the effectiveness of such a policy is unclear given relatively low spruce growth rates in the region. Further convoluting the picture is the magnitude and relevance of surface albedo changes linked to such projects, which typically counteract the benefits of an enhanced forest CO2 sink in high-latitude regions. Here, we carry out a rigorous empirically based assessment of the terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) potential of large-scale spruce planting in Norway, taking into account transient developments in both terrestrial carbon sinks and surface albedo over the 21st century and beyond. We find that surface albedo changes would likely play a negligible role in counteracting tCDR, yet given low forest growth rates in the region, notable tCDR benefits from such projects would not be realized until the second half of the 21st century, with maximum benefits occurring even later around 2150. We estimate Norway's total accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 and 2150 (including surface albedo changes) to be 447 (±240) and 852 (±295) Mt CO2-eq. at mean net present values of US\$ 12 (±3) and US\$ 13 (±2) per ton CDR, respectively. For perspective, the accumulated tCDR potential at 2100 represents around 8 years of Norway's total current annual production-based (i.e., territorial) CO2-eq. emissions.},

  abstract = {Reproduction by individuals is typically recorded as count data (e.g., number of fledglings from a nest or inflorescences on a plant) and commonly modeled using Poisson or negative binomial distributions, which assume that variance is greater than or equal to the mean. However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance {$<$} mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.},

  abstract = {Sustainably managed non-native trees deliver economic and societal benefits with limited risk of spread to adjoining areas. However, some plantations have launched invasions that cause substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services, while others pose substantial threats of causing such impacts. The challenge is to maximise the benefits of non-native trees, while minimising negative impacts and preserving future benefits and options.  A workshop was held in 2019 to develop global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees, using the Council of Europe – Bern Convention Code of Conduct on Invasive Alien Trees as a starting point.  The global guidelines consist of eight recommendations: 1) Use native trees, or non-invasive non-native trees, in preference to invasive non-native trees; 2) Be aware of and comply with international, national, and regional regulations concerning non-native trees; 3) Be aware of the risk of invasion and consider global change trends; 4) Design and adopt tailored practices for plantation site selection and silvicultural management; 5) Promote and implement early detection and rapid response programmes; 6) Design and adopt tailored practices for invasive non-native tree control, habitat restoration, and for dealing with highly modified ecosystems; 7) Engage with stakeholders on the risks posed by invasive non-native trees, the impacts caused, and the options for management; and 8) Develop and support global networks, collaborative research, and information sharing on native and non-native trees.  The global guidelines are a first step towards building global consensus on the precautions that should be taken when introducing and planting non-native trees. They are voluntary and are intended to complement statutory requirements under international and national legislation. The application of the global guidelines and the achievement of their goals will help to conserve forest biodiversity, ensure sustainable forestry, and contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations linked with forest biodiversity.},

This study aims to perform an inventory of the most frequent non-native tree species growing in European forests and analyse their current extent, geographic distribution and geographic origin. Our results show that at least 150 nonnative tree species are currently growing in European forests and provenance trials. The genera represented by largest number of species are Eucalyptus, Pinus, Acacia and Abies. Species growing at the largest areas are Robinia pseudoacacia (2.44 million ha), Eucalyptus globulus (1.46 million ha), Picea sitchensis (1.16 million ha) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (0.83 million ha). In total, non-native tree species in Europe are found in an area of approximately 8.54 million ha, or 4.0\% of the European forest area, and the five most abundant species account for up to 77\% of this area. The largest number of these 150 species were introduced from North America (71), followed by Asia (45) and Australia (20). North American species occupy by far the largest area.},

  abstract = {We aim to develop a simple model to explore how disturbance and propagule pressure determine conditions for successful invasion in systems where recruitment occurs only in disturbed sites. Disturbance is often thought to favour invaders as it allows recruitment; however, the effects of disturbance are more complicated when it results in mortality of the invader. When disturbance rates in both invader occupied and unoccupied sites are the same, recruitment and mortality effects are exactly balanced, and successful invasion is independent of the disturbance regime. Differences in the disturbance rates between invader occupied and unoccupied sites can occur through invader modification or management of disturbance. Under these conditions, we found a novel mechanism for the generation of an Allee effect, which occurs when the invader promotes disturbance in sites it already occupies. When Allee effects occur one-off, large-scale disturbances can result in permanent, dramatic shifts in invader abundance; and conversely, reducing the population below a critical threshold can cause extinction.},

  abstract = {1 Management decisions regarding invasive plants often have to be made quickly and in the face of fragmentary knowledge of their population dynamics. However, recommendations are commonly made on the basis of only a restricted set of parameters. Without addressing uncertainty and variability in model parameters we risk ineffective management, resulting in wasted resources and an escalating problem if early chances to control spread are missed. 2 Using available data for Pinus nigra in ungrazed and grazed grassland and shrubland in New Zealand, we parameterized a stage-structured spread model to calculate invasion wave speed, population growth rate and their sensitivities and elasticities to population parameters. Uncertainty distributions of parameters were used with the model to generate confidence intervals (CI) about the model predictions. 3 Ungrazed grassland environments were most vulnerable to invasion and the highest elasticities and sensitivities of invasion speed were to long-distance dispersal parameters. However, there was overlap between the elasticity and sensitivity CI on juvenile survival, seedling establishment and long-distance dispersal parameters, indicating overlap in their effects on invasion speed. 4 While elasticity of invasion speed to long-distance dispersal was highest in shrubland environments, there was overlap with the CI of elasticity to juvenile survival. In shrubland invasion speed was most sensitive to the probability of establishment, especially when establishment was low. In the grazed environment elasticity and sensitivity of invasion speed to the severity of grazing were consistently highest. Management recommendations based on elasticities and sensitivities depend on the vulnerability of the habitat. 5 Synthesis and applications. Despite considerable uncertainty in demography and dispersal, robust management recommendations emerged from the model. Proportional or absolute reductions in long-distance dispersal, juvenile survival and seedling establishment parameters have the potential to reduce wave speed substantially. Plantations of wind-dispersed invasive conifers should not be sited on exposed sites vulnerable to long-distance dispersal events, and trees in these sites should be removed. Invasion speed can also be reduced by removing seedlings, establishing competitive shrubs and grazing. Incorporating uncertainty into the modelling process increases our confidence in the wide applicability of the management strategies recommended here.},

  abstract = {To address the lack of information about the shape and extent of real dispersal kernels, Bullock et al. (Journal of Ecology 105:6-19, 2017) synthesised empirical information on seed dispersal distances. Testing the fit of a variety of probability density functions, they found no function was the best-fitting for all datasets but some outperformed others. Cousens et al. (Journal of Ecology, 2017) focus on the specific finding of the generally poor fit of the WALD function to wind dispersal data and use this to argue that mechanistically derived functions would not be expected to fit data particularly well. We agree in part with this argument and discuss the issues that may lead to poor fit, including the simplifying assumptions of the WALD and the complexity of the dispersal process. We explain the fundamental linkage between the mechanistic form of the WALD and the derived function used for fitting to data. We demonstrate, however, that the logic that a mechanistically based function could fit to data is valid, under the hypothesis that it encompasses the key processes determining the dispersal kernel. This argument is supported by the facts that: (1) our analyses and others have shown the WALD performs well in a number of cases; and (2) the WALD is the best-fitting function for an example in which we simulate dispersal data using a realistic representation of variability in the wind dispersal process. Synthesis. While there are reasons that mechanistically derived functions may not fit well to empirical data, they do in some empirical and simulated cases and this suggests they can capture the dispersal behaviour of real systems. Mechanistic functions should be explored along with other more general functions when describing empirical data to investigate their simplifying assumptions and to add to our arsenal of functions for analysing dispersal data. Analyses using these functions are critical if we are to move from simply describing the system in which the data were gathered to gaining more general insights into dispersal and predicting its consequences.},

  abstract = {1 Where competition with established vegetation limits plant recruitment, fires create open conditions which can allow invasive species to establish. However, facilitation theory suggests that destruction of vegetation will restrict germination and survival. These hypotheses were tested in a long-term study of establishment by Pinus sylvestris– a globally important invasive – on English temperate heaths. 2 Pine seeds were sown at 10 sites which represented replicated stages of heath recovery after fire: from bare soil to dense, tall vegetation. 3 Seedling emergence varied among stages from 3\% to 36\% and was closely related to vegetation density, increasing with lower shrub height. The same pattern was evident within sites where seedlings emerged mostly at sowing locations with little or no vegetation. 4 Yearly seedling survival showed a quadratic relationship with vegetation density over the first 4 years; with extremely high ({$>$} 95\%) mortality in both very open and very dense conditions, but low mortality ({$<$} 30\%) under intermediate cover. Over the subsequent 5 years seedling mortality did not differ among stages or with vegetation density. 5 The initial conditions after fire constrain invasion because high emergence is countered by high mortality. However, the moderate shrub density during the first decade post-fire enhances P. sylvestris seedling survival and so promotes invasion. Invasibility is low in dense mature heath, but becomes high as shrubs collapse in degenerate heath which increases seedling emergence and survival. 6 Synthesis. This study provides evidence that facilitation can occur in temperate regions, and that the plant interactions within a heathland community are a balance of competition and facilitation. This balance is governed by vegetation structure and plant ontogeny. Dominance of competition in more dense vegetation and for seedling emergence changed to facilitative effects in less dense vegetation and for older seedlings.},

  abstract = {In many countries, plantation forestry depends mostly on a small number of fast-growing exotic species (mainly eucalypts and pines). These species are highly productive but may also become invasive in the communities surrounding plantations. The spread of alien species depends on characteristics of the species itself (species invasiveness) and of the host community (community invasibility), so that some habitats are more vulnerable than others to the invasion of a given species. Our aim in this study is to assess the ability of Eucalyptus globulus to spread in the absence of fire from plantations into the three most common types of surrounding habitats in the study area (NW Spain; native forests, pine plantations and shrublands) and to make recommendations to minimize the risk of spread. We independently assessed propagule pressure and community invasibility by measuring (1) the amount of seeds of E. globulus reaching different distances from the edge of plantations, and (2) seedling emergence and survival in the three types of habitats mentioned. We then estimated the density of seedling and sapling recruitment at different distances from plantation edges by means of a stochastic model parameterized with field data. Seed dispersal distances up to 80m were recorded, with the frequency distribution of dispersal distances being strongly leptokurtic. Most E. globulus seeds were recorded in the first 5m from plantation edges (84.3\%), and 98.6\% in the first 15m. Native forests were the most resistant to E. globulus spread, showing lower seedling emergence (0.9\% vs. 3.3\% and 2.2\% in shrublands and pine plantations) and survival (3.7\% vs. 17.5\% and 19.9\% up to 6months). Despite relatively low establishment success ratio, high seed production leads to considerable seedling densities in surrounding habitats, especially in pine plantations and shrublands. In order to control E. globulus spread, we recommend eliminating all new recruits in a safety belt around plantations (e.g. a 15-m wide belt could reduce recruitment in c. 95\%) while they can be easily uprooted (1–2years) and have not reached sexual maturity. Given the resistance of native forests to eucalypt establishment, fostering this type of vegetation in those belts would facilitate their maintenance and increase their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Tree plantations are an important cause of plant invasions worldwide, being a serious concern for biodiversity conservation. Pinus and Eucalyptus are the two most important genera for the forestry industry worldwide, with Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata among the most widespread and invasive. In this study we analyse the establishment of wildlings of these two species in native eucalypt forests (karri and jarrah forests) of SW Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. We selected boundaries between plantations and adjoining native forests (26 for E. globulus and 25 for P. radiata) and established in each a plot 100\,m long (aligned to outer edge of forest)\,×\,100\,m or 50\,m deep into the native forest (for boundaries with P. radiata and E. globulus plantations, respectively), that was thoroughly searched for wildlings. Eucalyptus globulus wildlings were only found in 3 of the 26 boundaries studied, 6 individuals in total, all within first 10\,m from the forest edge. Pinus radiata wildlings were found in all boundaries and at all distances inspected. Wildling density was greater in jarrah forest compared to karri forest (mean 70.7 and 24.7 wildlings ha−1; respectively); it was negatively correlated with understorey cover (r\,=\,−0.501, F\,=\,7.72, p\,=\,0.011) and the density of older wildlings (20\,+\,years) was positively correlated with time since plantation establishment (r\,=\,0.512; F\,=\,8.16; P\,=\,0.009). Invasion of native eucalypt forests by alien E. globulus does not seem currently of concern in SW Australia. The scheduled short rotations (8–10\,years), which means that trees are mostly harvested before reaching their full reproductive potential, lower dispersal ability than P. radiata and the customary establishment of cleared margins around plantations (10\,m wide on average) all contribute to reduce the propagule pressure in native forests and with it the invasion potential. Nevertheless, attention should be paid to abandoned plantations left unharvested for longer, which may increase the invasion risks. In contrast, P. radiata plantations do constitute a threat to native vegetation for the invasion capacity of this species, as indicated by the presence of wildlings in all native forests studied, together with the relatively high density of old trees with high reproductive capacity in the forests interior. Awareness about wilding pine spread is urgently needed in SW Australia, in order to minimise the risks.},

  abstract = {Biological invasion by non-native tree species can transform landscapes, and as a consequence, has received growing attention from researchers and managers alike. This problem is driven primarily by the naturalisation and invasion of tree species escaping from cultivation or forestry plantations. Furthermore, these invasions can be strongly influenced by the land-use matrix of the surrounding region, specific management of the source populations, and environmental conditions that influence seed dispersal or habitat quality for the invader. A major unresolved challenge for managing tree invasions in landscapes is how management should be deployed to contain or slow the spread of invading populations from one or more sources (e.g. plantations). We develop a spatial simulation model to test: (1) how to best prioritise the control of invasive tree populations spatially to slow or contain the biological invader when habitat quality varies in the landscape, and (2) how to allocate control effort among different management units when trees spread from many source populations. We first show that to slow down spread effectively, management strategy is less important than management effort. We then identify the conditions affecting the relative performance of different management strategies. At the landscape scale, targeting peripheral stands consistently yielded the best results whereas at the regional scale, management strategies needed to account for both habitat quality and tree life-history. Overall, our findings demonstrate that knowledge of how habitat affects tree life-history stages can improve management to contain or slow tree invasions by improving the spatial match between management effort and efficacy.},

  abstract = {The role of plant diversity in reducing invasions has generated decades of debate. Diverse communities might be more resistant to invasion because the communities contain resident species that are functionally similar to the invader (limiting similarity), or multiple species use the range of available resources more effectively (complementarity) than single species. However, the correlation of native and exotic diversity often reverses, becoming positive, with increasing spatial and temporal scale, in a phenomenon called the invasion paradox. We addressed two groups of hypotheses related to this paradox, broadly that (1) functional diversity and identity resist invasion initially, via complementarity or limiting similarity; and (2) disturbance and propagule pressure weaken the effects of functional diversity and identity on invader success through time. Using long-term data from experimental serpentine grassland assemblages in California, we examined how the abundance of a high impact invader, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), related to functional diversity, functional dissimilarity, pocket gopher disturbance, and propagule pressure. We also conducted a single-season experiment in which we seeded disturbed and undisturbed areas and quantified invader success the following year. Neither diversity, nor dissimilarity, nor disturbance significantly impacted the success of C. solstitialis during the years of this study. Instead, propagule pressure was the single most important predictor of C. solstitialis abundance. We consolidated these findings into a novel conceptual model of invader success to illustrate how propagule input may outweigh community resistance through time, and what implications these dynamics have for the invasion paradox.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the recovery of abandoned tropical pastures to secondary rainforest benefits from the arrival of seeds from adjacent rainforest patches. Less is known, however, about how the structural attributes of adjacent rainforest (e.g. tree density, canopy cover and tree height) impact seed rain patterns into abandoned pastures. Between 2011 and 2013, we used seed traps and ground seed surveys to track the richness and abundance of rainforest seeds entering abandoned pastures in Australia's wet tropics. We also tested how seed rain diversity is related to the distance from forest, the proportion of forest cover in the landscape and several structural attributes of adjacent forest patches, specifically average tree height, canopy cover, tree species richness and density. Almost no seeds were captured in elevated pasture seed traps, even near forest remnants. Abundant forest seeds were found in ground surveys but only within 10 m of forest edges. In ground surveys, seeds from wind-dispersed species were more abundant, but less species rich, than animal-dispersed species. A survey of pasture seedling recruits suggested that some forest seeds must be dispersing more than 10 m into pasture at very low frequencies, but only a few species are establishing there. Recruits were predominantly animal-dispersed not wind-dispersed species. In addition to distance from forest and the proportion of forest within a 100- to 200-m radius of sampling sites, the richness and density of adjacent forest trees were the most important factors for explaining the probability of seed occurrence in abandoned pastures. Results suggest that without some restoration assistance, the recovery of abandoned pastures into secondary rainforest in Australia's tropical rainforests will likely be limited, at least in part, by a very low rate of seed dispersal away from forest edges and by the diversity and density of trees in adjacent remnant forests.},

  abstract = {1 Although invasions by alien plants are major threats to the biodiversity of natural habitats, individual habitats vary considerably in their susceptibility to invasion. Therefore the risk assessment procedures, which are used increasingly by environmental managers to inform effective planning of invasive plant control, require reliable quantitative information on the extent to which different habitats are susceptible to invasion. It is also important to know whether the levels of invasion in different habitats are locally specific or consistent among regions with contrasting climate, flora and history of human impact. 2 We compiled a database of 52 480 vegetation plots from three regions of Europe: Catalonia (Mediterranean–submediterranean region), Czech Republic (subcontinental) and Great Britain (oceanic). We classified plant species into neophytes, archaeophytes and natives, and calculated the proportion of each group in 33 habitats described by the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) classification. 3 Of 545 alien species found in the plots, only eight occurred in all three regions. Despite this large difference in species composition, patterns of habitat invasions were highly consistent between regions. None or few aliens were found in environmentally extreme and nutrient-poor habitats, e.g. mires, heathlands and high-mountain grasslands. Many aliens were found in frequently disturbed habitats with fluctuating nutrient availability, e.g. in man-made habitats. Neophytes were also often found in coastal, littoral and riverine habitats. 4 Neophytes were found commonly in habitats also occupied by archaeophytes. Thus, the number of archaeophytes can be considered as a good predictor of the neophyte invasion risk. However, neophytes had stronger affinity to wet habitats and disturbed woody vegetation while archaeophytes tended to be more common in dry to mesic open habitats. 5 Synthesis and applications. The considerable inter-regional consistency of the habitat invasion patterns suggests that habitats can be used as a good predictor for the invasion risk assessment. This finding opens promising perspectives for the use of spatially explicit information on habitats, including scenarios of future land-use change, to identify the areas of highest risk of invasion.},

  abstract = {Habitats vary considerably in the level of invasion (number or proportion of alien plant species they contain), which depends on local habitat properties, propagule pressure, and climate. To determine the invasibility (susceptibility to invasions) of different habitats, it is necessary to factor out the effects of any confounding variables such as propagule pressure and climate on the level of invasion. We used 20 468 vegetation plots from 32 habitats in the Czech Republic to compare the invasibility of different habitats. Using regression trees, the proportion of alien plants, including archaeophytes (prehistoric to medieval invaders) and neophytes (recent invaders), was related to variables representing habitat properties, propagule pressure, and climate. The propagule pressure was expressed as the proportion of surrounding urban and industrial or agricultural land, human population density, distance from a river, and history of human colonization in the region. Urban and industrial land use had a positive effect on the proportion of both archaeophytes and neophytes. Agricultural land use, higher population density, and longer history of human impact positively affected the proportion of archaeophytes. Disturbed human-made habitats with herbaceous vegetation were most invaded by both groups of aliens. Neophytes were also relatively common in disturbed woody vegetation, such as broad-leaved plantations, forest clearings, and riverine scrub. These habitats also had the highest proportion of aliens after removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, indicating that they are not only the most invaded, but also most invasible. These habitats experience recurrent disturbances and are rich, at least temporarily, in available nutrients, which supports the hypothesis that fluctuating resources are the major cause of habitat invasibility. The least invaded habitats were mires and alpine-subalpine grasslands and scrub. After removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, some habitats actually invaded at an intermediate level had very low proportions of aliens. This indicates that these habitats (e.g., dry, wet, and saline grasslands, base-rich fens, and broad-leaved deciduous woodlands) are resistant to invasion.},

  abstract = {Invasion ecology has been criticised for its lack of general principles. To explore this criticism, we conducted a meta-analysis that examined characteristics of invasiveness (i.e. the ability of species to establish in, spread to, or become abundant in novel communities) and invasibility (i.e. the susceptibility of habitats to the establishment or proliferation of invaders). There were few consistencies among invasiveness characteristics (3 of 13): established and abundant invaders generally occupy similar habitats as native species, while abundant species tend to be less affected by enemies; germination success and reproductive output were significantly positively associated with invasiveness when results from both stages (establishment/spread and abundance/impact) were combined. Two of six invasibility characteristics were also significant: communities experiencing more disturbance and with higher resource availability sustained greater establishment and proliferation of invaders. We also found that even though ‘propagule pressure’ was considered in only \textasciitilde 29\% of studies, it was a significant predictor of both invasiveness and invasibility (55 of 64 total cases). Given that nonindigenous species are likely introduced non-randomly, we contend that ‘propagule biases’ may confound current paradigms in invasion ecology. Examples of patterns that could be confounded by propagule biases include characteristics of good invaders and susceptible habitats, release from enemies, evolution of ‘invasiveness’, and invasional meltdown. We conclude that propagule pressure should serve as the basis of a null model for studies of biological invasions when inferring process from patterns of invasion.},

Subspecies latifolia is the most extensive and economically important in North America. Serotiny is common in this subspecies, but trees bearing nonserotinous cones can be found in most stands, sometimes constituting more that 70\% of the trees. Cone crops are produced yearly and seed loss to seed predators, insects and diseases are minimal. Germination and establishment occurs across a broad range of conditions allowing lodgepole pine to grow on poor sites as well as highly productive sites.

  abstract = {A critical question in invasion biology involves the relative importance of propagule rain and community invasibility. For plant invasions, invasibility is often related to disturbance, but few studies of forest invaders have simultaneously investigated both canopy and ground-level disturbance. We investigated the relative importance of seed rain, canopy disturbance, and soil disturbance in a mature forest in Maryland on the recruitment of four invasive species: wine raspberry (Rubus phoenicolasius Maxim.), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb.), and Japanese stiltgrass [Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus]. Using complete censuses of a 9-ha plot at two points in time (2011–12 and 2014), we mapped new recruits, and related their locations to canopy and soil disturbance, as well as to a seed rain index based on locations of reproducing plants and seed-dispersal kernels.We found that propagule rain, as measured by the seed rain index, was a significant predictor of recruitment for B. thunbergii, R. phoenicolasius, and M. vimineum. For R. multiflora, seed sources were not located, precluding assessment of propagule rain, but recruitment was linked to canopy disturbance, as was recruitment of M. vimineum. However, because reproduction of R. phoenicolasius and, in some years, of B. thunbergii is higher in treefall gaps, these gaps experience higher propagule rain, with the result that recruitment is indirectly associated with these gaps. Ground-layer disturbance was an important predictor of recruitment only for B. thunbergii. Our findings reveal that the importance of propagule rain is the most consistent driver of recruitment, but canopy or ground-layer disturbance promotes recruitment of some invasive plant species.},

  abstract = {The North American tree Pinus contorta var. latifolia was experimentally introduced in Sweden already in the 1920s, and has been used in Swedish forestry on a large scale since the 1970s. These plantations now cover 565,000ha, mainly in the northern area. In this paper we summarize and discuss existing ecological knowledge of this species introduction. With regard to long-term sustainability we suggest management means to minimize harmful effects of the introduction on ecosystems. These include aspects of self dispersal, pests, ecosystem and landscape structures, and also ecological processes and biodiversity. We also focus on observed and possible interactions in the ecosystems. As Pinus contorta seeds are disseminated and trees regenerated outside initial plantations, this may have future bearings on biodiversity. We suggest a strategy which takes account of the uncertainty in predicting future ecological effects. The strategy includes areal restrictions and zones without Pinus contorta, but also to set up a monitoring program. Observations of adverse effects from the plantations would then give the possibility to adjust P. contorta management.},

  abstract = {Question Are the patterns of alien conifer (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) invasions different between continents, and how is invasion success influenced by commercial forestry practices? Location Temperate and subtropical countries and regions (n = 60) from five continents spanning both hemispheres. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models to test how continent identity, region area and use in commercial forestry affect probabilities of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species to escape following introduction and cumulative logit regression models to assess how these predictors affect the likelihood that a species becomes naturalized or invasive. Results Sixty Pinaceae of a global total of 232 and 26 Cupressaceae of a total of 142 species have escaped from cultivation across the study regions examined. Average numbers of both alien Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species per region were highest in Oceania, followed by Africa. Moreover, the probability of alien Cupressaceae and Pinaceae becoming naturalized or invasive was particularly high in these two continents. For both families, species used in commercial forestry have a significantly higher probability of escape than those which are only introduced for ornamental or other purposes. In the case of Pinaceae, forestry species also become naturalized or invasive more frequently than non-forestry species, while no such effect was detectable for Cupressaceae. Conclusions We found that non-native conifers are more likely to escape from cultivation, naturalize and turn into invasive weeds on the continents of the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to this biogeographic signal, introduction effort strongly determines the behaviour of introduced Pinaceae, and less so, Cupressaceae. A clear conflict exists between the economic benefits of conifer forestry and the risks to the environment from invasions. Future expansion of commercial forestry should address spatial planning to ecosystems vulnerable to invasion and adopt comprehensive risk assessment procedures.},

  abstract = {Introduced tree species are increasingly being considered for use in production forestry due to production targets, and demand for a diversity of wood products. However, prior to expanding their use, active consideration needs to be given to the breadth of potential ecological consequences associated with each introduced tree species. Ecological consequences include the invasion and modification of sensitive ecosystems, changes in habitat provision for native taxa, altered risk of pest and pathogen outbreaks, and hybridization with native con-generics. Here we review the scientific literature to assess the potential ecological consequences from expanding the use of introduced tree species within Swedish forestry. We use an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate ecological risks, and our assessment is based on the scenario that a proportion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures in southern Sweden will be replaced by monocultures of Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), hybrid aspen (Populus tremula tremuloides), or hybrid larch (Larix eurolepis/L. marschlinsii). Our results highlight that univariate consideration of the ecological consequences of exotic tree species can be highly misleading, due to the complex suite of costs, benefits, risks and uncertainties that each tree species brings to the region of introduction. We discuss our results in relation to conflicting management goals, and the lack of reversibility of some adverse ecological outcomes. We also highlight the need for assessments of ecological risk to facilitate evidence-based decision making by stakeholders. Our results provide a foundation for adaptive management programs aiming to limit the extent to which introduced tree species used in production forestry are accompanied by adverse ecological impacts.},

  abstract = {The tree species used in planted forests are highly productive and have an important role in countries economy but the expansion of these trees into habitats outside plantations is a concern for managers and conservationists. Among the most planted forest species worldwide, we can find eucalypts and pines species. Understanding spatial patterns and the factors that influence these species colonization is crucial to increase the knowledge about expansion capability of these species and may help managers to improve and prioritize eventual control plans. Our study aimed to identify the recruitment spatial patterns of Pinus pinaster (native species) and Eucalyptus globulus (exotic species) into habitats surrounding plantations in Portugal (native forests, grasslands and shrublands) and to determine the factors that influence recruitment. This was done by looking at the recruitment success in several habitats near plantations, using a spatial gradient of distance to plantations edge. We observed as expected that the recruitment of P. pinaster and E. globulus decreased exponentially from the plantation edge. However, the higher P. pinaster seedling recruitment in this study (P. pinaster: 247 seedlings/ha; E. globulus: 22 seedlings/ha), the smallest decline in seedlings density with distance from plantation boundary (P. pinaster=−0.036seedlings/m vs E. globulus=−0.048seedlings/m), and the longer distance of seedling establishment, demonstrate clearly that P. pinaster is more successful colonizing the habitats near plantations than E. globulus. Nevertheless E. globulus can growth seedlings within the planted stands suggesting that the species is becoming naturalized. However, localized recruitment (92\% of the total seedlings recorded were located less than 15m from the plantation edge) and lower levels of establishment of E. globulus from managed plantations, suggested that this species did not demonstrate an invasive behavior. However, future research in abandoned eucalyptus plantation is needed to understand the role of plantation management and age as barriers to E. globulus colonization. Results from our survey revealed the suitability of all habitat types studied for P. pinaster natural regeneration, although their recruitment was more limited in forest habitat type. Forest and grassland were very resistant to E. globulus establishment. The two species recruitment was also influenced by different factors, with P. pinaster being independent of climatic variables, while E. globulus was affected by temperature seasonality and recruitment was found to be higher in areas with lower seasonal differences.},

We aimed to evaluate the establishment capacity of E. globulus from plantations into natural habitats and to understand its association with the climate, plantation characteristics and host site characteristics. We surveyed 50 E. globulus plantations across Portugal looking at the natural establishment (occurrence and density) of E. globulus in habitats adjacent to plantations. Eucalypts presence was only recorded in 8\% of the plots. Site characteristics (such as habitat type, vegetation cover and disturbance) were the most important variables influencing the natural recruitment of E. globulus in comparison to climate or plantation variables. Forest and grassland were the most resistant habitats to eucalyptus invasion while highly disturbed areas can be considered hubs for eucalypt density. The high importance of site characteristics reflects that most of the variability in eucalypt establishment occurs at small spatial scales. Thus, monitoring and management efforts should focus on those sites with higher establishment probability (i.e. open areas) trying to promote native vegetation and reduce disturbance levels.},

  abstract = {Pine invasion is a global threat that is occurring in native forests of diverse regions of the world. This process is arising in a scenario of rapid forest deforestation and degradation. Therefore, elucidate which forests attributes explain invasibility is a central issue in forest ecology. The Coastal Maulino forest is an endemic forest of central Chile, which has suffered a large history of disturbance, being replaced by large extensions of Pinus radiata plantations. This land transformation conveys high rates of pines invasion into native remnants. In this study we examined to what extent structural features of forest patches explains invasibility of this forest-type. Within eight forest fragments, we sampled 162 plots (10 x 10 m2 each). We quantified seedling pine density and related these estimates with tree cover, litter depth, PAR radiation, and diversity of the resident community. Our results indicate that canopy cover was the most important variable to determine seedling pine density within forest fragments. Our investigation highlights the importance to conserve the forests cover to reduce significantly their invasibility. This action can be effective even if we cannot avoid pine plantations in the region as a source of a massive seed dispersal to forests with well conserved canopy.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is an inherently spatial process that can be affected by habitat conditions in sites encountered by dispersers. Understanding landscape resistance to dispersal is important in connectivity studies and reserve design, but most existing methods use resistance functions with cost parameters that are subjectively chosen by the investigator. We develop an analytic approach allowing for direct estimation of resistance parameters that folds least cost path methods typically used in simulation approaches into a formal statistical model of dispersal distributions. The core of our model is a frequency distribution of dispersal distances expressed as least cost distance rather than Euclidean distance, and which includes terms for feature-specific costs to dispersal and sex (or other traits) of the disperser. The model requires only origin and settlement locations for multiple individuals, such as might be obtained from mark–recapture studies or parentage analyses, and maps of the relevant habitat features. To evaluate whether the model can estimate parameters correctly, we fit our model to data from simulated dispersers in three kinds of landscapes (in which resistance of environmental variables was categorical, continuous with a patchy configuration, or continuous in a trend pattern). We found maximum likelihood estimators of resistance and individual trait parameters to be approximately unbiased with moderate sample sizes. We applied the model to a small grizzly bear dataset to demonstrate how this approach could be used when the primary interest is in the prediction of costs and found that estimates were consistent with expectations based on bear ecology. Our method has important practical applications for testing hypotheses about dispersal ecology and can be used to inform connectivity planning efforts, via the resistance estimates and confidence intervals, which can be used to create a data-driven resistance surface.},

  abstract = {NORA10EI, a new atmosphere and wave hindcast for the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and the Barents Sea is presented. The hindcast uses ERA-Interim as initial and boundary conditions and covers the period 1979–2017. The earlier NORA10 hindcast used ERA-40 as initial and boundary conditions before September 2002 and operational analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in the continuation. This change in initial and boundary conditions may lead to non-stationarities in bias and random errors, and it is a question of some concern whether this also leads to spurious trends. We investigate this by comparing the two hindcasts. We find only minor differences in the statistics of means and upper percentiles, but somewhat larger differences in the extremes (100-year return values) of significant wave height and 10-m winds. Generally, NORA10EI outperforms NORA10 in the ERA-40 period (before September 2002) since ERA-Interim outperforms ERA-40. Conversely, NORA10 outperforms NORA10EI after 2006, since the operational ECMWF analyses here outperform ERA-Interim. Years 2002–2006 is a transition period with minor differences between the NORA10 and NORA10EI where the resolution of ERA-Interim is lower than that of the ECMWF analyses, but its physics are from a more recent model (2006). An important finding is that the regional hindcasts appear quite insensitive to changes in the host reanalysis with no statistically significant differences in mean and upper percentile trends of wind speed and wave height. A comparison of four polar low cases confirms that using ERA-Interim as host reanalysis yields a slightly better representation of evolution and intensity of polar lows than NORA10 in the ERA-40 period and the opposite after 2006.},

In a rapidly changing world, where nature is under constant pressure, standardized terms and methods for characterization of ecological diversity are urgently needed (e.g., to enhance precision and credibility of global change assessments). Aim The aim is to present the EcoSyst framework, a set of general principles and methods for systematization of natural diversity that simultaneously addresses biotic and abiotic variation, and to discuss perspectives opened by this framework. Innovation EcoSyst provides a framework for systematizing natural variation in a consistent manner across different levels of organization. At each ecodiversity level, EcoSyst principles can be used to establish: (a) an extensive attribute system with descriptive variables that cover all relevant sources of variation; (b) a hierarchical-type system; and (c) a set of guidelines for land-cover mapping that is consistent across spatial scales. EcoSyst type systems can be conceptualized as multidimensional models, by which a key characteristic (the response) is related to variation in one or more key sources of variation (predictors). EcoSyst type hierarchies are developed by a gradient-based iterative procedure, by which the “ecodiversity distance” (i.e., the extent to which the key characteristic differs between adjacent candidate types) is standardized and the ecological processes behind observed patterns are explicitly taken into account. Application We present “Nature in Norway” (NiN), an implementation of the EcoSyst framework for Norway for the ecosystem and landscape levels of ecodiversity. Examples of applications to research and management are given. Conclusion The EcoSyst framework provides a theoretical platform, principles and methods that can complement and enhance initiatives towards a global-scale systematics of ecodiversity.},

  abstract = {Real quantities can undergo such a wide variety of dynamics that the mean is often a meaningless reference point for measuring variability. Despite their widespread application, techniques like the Coefficient of Variation are not truly proportional and exhibit pathological properties. The non-parametric measure Proportional Variability (PV) [1] resolves these issues and provides a robust way to summarize and compare variation in quantities exhibiting diverse dynamical behaviour. Instead of being based on deviation from an average value, variation is simply quantified by comparing the numbers to each other, requiring no assumptions about central tendency or underlying statistical distributions. While PV has been introduced before and has already been applied in various contexts to population dynamics, here we present a deeper analysis of this new measure, derive analytical expressions for the PV of several general distributions and present new comparisons with the Coefficient of Variation, demonstrating cases in which PV is the more favorable measure. We show that PV provides an easily interpretable approach for measuring and comparing variation that can be generally applied throughout the sciences, from contexts ranging from stock market stability to climate variation.},

  abstract = {Aim To investigate the medium to long-distance dispersal abilities of temperate hardwood tree species and the ecological controls on dispersal, including distance to and connectivity with seed sources, seed source strength, and species dispersal mechanism and seed size. Location A fragmented forest system in the Long Point region, Southern Ontario. Methods Pine plantations were the `seed traps' in which seedlings of hardwood species were enumerated to indicate past dispersal events. The influence of distance to seed sources, dispersal mechanism and seed mass on the probability of dispersal to plantations were evaluated using logistic analysis. Regression analysis was used to determine the effect of seed source strength (mature tree abundance within 150 m of plantations) on seedling density in plantations. Connectivity was assessed by comparing the strength of correlations between seedling abundance in plantations and the abundance of mature trees around plantations in connected vs. unconnected source areas. Results Seedling presence in plantations decreased significantly with distance from the nearest potential seed source for species grouped according to dispersal mechanism. Probabilities of seedling presence were ≥0.8 at 25 m distances, decreasing to under 0.3 at 175 m distances. While twenty-seven of twenty-nine species were present in at least one plantation with a seed source within 25 m, only thirteen of twenty-seven species occurred in plantations with a seed source ≥100 m away, and only nine of twenty-four species in plantations ≥150 m from seed sources, indicating limited potentials for interfragment migration. Seed source strength was significantly related to seedling density in plantations for twelve of fifteen species tested, indicating the importance of species commonness to interfragment migration. Connectivity was not related to dispersal frequency in the system, but this finding applies to a relatively well-connected system of forests and plantations and is expected to differ for systems with greater patch isolation. In addition to these general controls, dispersal was related to species dispersal mechanism. Seed size was negatively related to dispersal frequency, but only within the rodent dispersal spectra. Bird-dispersed species appeared to have superior interfragment dispersal abilities, closely followed by lighter seeded rodent- and wind-dispersed species. Large-seeded rodent-dispersed species (Juglans spp., Quercus macrocarpa) and species lacking well-developed adaptations for dispersers were infrequent in plantations generally, and with the exception of Q. macrocarpa, were absent from plantations more than 50 m from seed sources. Species dispersal abilities were ranked according to dispersal mechanism and seed size such that: bird {$>$} lighter-seeded rodent = wind {$>$} larger-seeded rodent = unspecialized. Main conclusions Distance to seed sources appears to be a key determinant of patch colonization. Infrequent dispersal over distances of {$>$}100–150 m for most species in this system raises concerns about the abilities of tree species to be sustained in fragmented forests. For some species, distances of as little as 50 m appear to be isolating, and these, in particular, risk regional extinctions over time scales depending on their local population persistence. Artificial introductions may be needed to maintain fragmented tree populations, particularly for rare species and those with poor dispersal indicated in this study.},

  abstract = {Current theories of plant invasion have been criticized for their limited heuristic and predictive value. We explore the heuristic and predictive potential of a model which explicitly simulates the mechanisms of plant invasion. The model, a spatially-explicit individual-based simulation, is applied to the invasion of pine trees (Pinus spp.; Pinaceae) in three vegetation types in the southern hemisphere. The model simulates factors which have been invoked as major determinants of invasive success: plant traits, environmental features and disturbance level. Results show that interactions between these determinants of invasive success are at least as important as the main effects. The complexity of invasions has promoted the belief that many factors must be invoked to explain invasions. This study shows that by incorporating interactions and mechanisms into our models we can potentially reduce the number of factors needed to predict plant invasions. The importance of interactions, however, means that predictions about invasions must be context-specific. The search for all-encompassing rules for invasions is therefore futile. The model presented here is of heuristic value since it improves our understanding of invasions, and of management value since it defines the data and models needed for predicting invasions.},

The foremost constraints on net habitat invasibility were the number of propagules that arrived at a site and naturally varying resident plant density. The physical environment (flooding regime) and the number of established resident species had negligible impact on habitat invasibility as compared to propagule pressure, despite manipulations that forced a significant reduction in resident richness, and a gradient in flooding from no flooding to annual flooding. This is the first experimental study to demonstrate the primacy of propagule pressure as a determinant of habitat invasibility in comparison with other candidate controlling factors.},

  abstract = {A numerical model (TurbSeed) is described which calculates explicitly the dispersal of plant seeds by wind, especially the fraction of seeds, which are transported more than 100m starting at the inflorescence. Such rare events are called here long-distance dispersal. The framework of TurbSeed includes three main modules:(1)A turbulence model (TM) for a specified location and time period using meteorological parameters from publicly available mesoscale weather models or simulated climate data.(2)A Lagrangian model (LM) which calculates the seed transport in the turbulent boundary layer and(3)A module which considers the effect of weather conditions on release of seeds (RS). In this approach the turbulent field is prescribed by a coarse wind field derived from the mesoscale climate simulations superimposed by a random velocity component. Similar approaches are known as Eulerian–Lagrangian approaches. The main difference in this new approach (TM) lies in the construction of the turbulent structure of the wind field. The introduction of such a random velocity component uses the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. An inverse random phase Fast-Fourier-Transformation reconstructs the time structure of turbulence using a parameterized power spectrum of turbulence which is accepted as standard in micro meteorology. In the LM module Monte-Carlo-Simulations for numerous trajectories are used to incorporate the effects of turbulence. The RS module takes into account various conditions of release of plant seeds, such as the date of maturity of the seeds and the effect of wind speed on the release of seeds. This model can be driven not only with data from observed weather conditions, but also with output of mesoscale climate scenarios. Thus, TurbSeed can study the effect of climate change on wind dispersal of seeds.},

  abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km2. Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km2. Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m × 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.},

Even though the tree has mostly serotine cones, adapted to open after forest fires, it has proved able to self-regenerate in Sweden. This study is the first to present, scientifically, the extent of self-regeneration covering the whole current range of LP-forests in Sweden. LP-saplings were recorded for three years, 2015–2017, in 8194 subplots distributed over 214 randomly selected LP-stands from latitude 59.6–66.9°N and altitude 88–710~m asl. Of all subplots, 3\% contained LP-saplings, and regeneration was found in 53\% of all stands. The probability of finding LP-saplings was significantly dependent on the plots’ distance from the edge of the LP-stand, and 78\% of all saplings were found within and up to 15~m beyond the stand edge. Most, 63\%, of the plots with LP were found on disturbed ground such as wheel tracks, roadsides and where there had been site preparation. The results show that LP can naturally spread under a range of conditions in the studied region. The regeneration is, however, concentrated in particular stands and should be possible to control with monitoring programmes and measures to eradicate self-dispersed trees in unwanted areas.},

Because we find that the fits to count data of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions are often similar, to understand their differences, we compare the probability mass functions and skewnesses of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions with the first two moments fixed. They have slight differences in many situations, but their zero-inflated distributions, with masses at zero, means and variances fixed, can differ more. These probabilistic comparisons are helpful in selecting a better fitting distribution for modelling count data with long right tails. Through a real example of count data with large zero fraction, we illustrate how the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions as well as their zero-inflated distributions can be discriminated.

The aim of this study was to determine the variations in the basic physical properties of seeds of selected spruce species and to identify the correlations between these attributes for the needs of the seed sorting processes. Terminal velocity, thickness, width, length, mass, and the angle of external friction were determined in the seeds of 11 spruce species. The measured parameters were used to calculate three aspect ratios (geometric mean diameter, sphericity index, and specific mass) of each seed. The average values of the basic physical properties of the analyzed seeds were determined in the following range: terminal velocity\&mdash;5.25 to 8.34 m s\&minus;1, thickness\&mdash;1.10 to 2.32 mm, width\&mdash;1.43 to 3.19 mm, length\&mdash;2.76 to 5.52 mm, the angle of external friction\&mdash;23.1 to 30.0\&deg;, and mass\&mdash;2.29 to 18.57 mg. The seeds of Jezo spruce and Meyer\&rsquo;s spruce were most similar to the seeds of other spruce species, whereas oriental spruce seeds differed most considerably from the remaining seeds. Our findings indicate that spruce seeds should be sorted primarily with the use of mesh sieves with longitudinal openings to obtain fractions with similar seed mass and to promote even germination.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal kernels of wind-dispersed species imprint the initial spatial template over which later demographic processes such as establishment or re-colonization operate from. A major knowledge gap in seed dispersal modeling by wind is the role of complex topography in modifying the kernel shape when referenced to the flat-world case. How complex topography modifies the dispersal kernels of inertial particles such as seeds is explored here via novel flume experiments. A train of gentle cosine hills and a canopy composed of densely arrayed rods with a roughness density resembling the leaf area density profile of hardwood species at maximum leaf area were used to represent a canopy-hill system. Spherical inertial particles having a coefficient of variation in terminal velocity commensurate with values reported from field studies were employed as model seeds. It was demonstrated that the seed dispersal kernel maintained its canonical ‘Wald’ form as derived from simplified turbulent dispersion theories for flat terrain and vertically uniform flow field. Seeds released near the canopy top and from the top of the hill have a dispersal kernel mean distance that was about 35\% times larger than its counterpart for releases from the bottom of the hill. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, defined here as seeds traversing a longitudinal distance exceeding 10 times the canopy height, were one order of magnitude larger for seeds released near the canopy top and from the hill top when compared to their counterpart released from the hill bottom.},

Also, we determine the proportions of a specific landscape in Sweden that are at varying distances from lodgepole pine and the degree to which landscape fragmentation may be increased by lodgepole pine plantations. The results indicate that all portions of the study area could receive wind-dispersed seed from existing lodgepole pine plantations, but that the level of additional fragmentation introduced by lodgepole pine in an already highly fragmented landscape is low. In general, however, the effects of forest fragmentation are compounded when the regeneration of native species is replaced by plantations of introduced species because new patch types are introduced. Even if the exotic species develop a forest structure similar to that produced by native species, a different kind of fragmentation — species fragmentation — is created that persists much longer than if only native species are involved. The ecological effects of introducing lodgepole pine, with a tree structure very similar to that of the native Scots pine, cannot yet be predicted with confidence, but managers should be cautious about creating new plantations in landscapes where there is a desire to avoid the invasion of an exotic species. Some research priorities are identified.},

  abstract = {Alien conifer invasions are affecting ecosystems across the globe, but until recently, reports of such invasions in South America were scarce. Pinus contorta was first established in Chilean Patagonia for erosion control caused by historical fires and cattle farming. Recently, the species has been planted over large areas for commercial purposes. It is well adapted to local conditions and is now spreading into natural areas. This study analyzes natural regeneration of Pinus contorta around Coyhaique city, Chile, to determine the spatial patterns of invasion. Five study sites were selected, four with grasslands dominated by exotic species and one site in the steppe. In each site, the plantation (seed source) was characterized using morphological attributes and density. Regeneration, density, height and age at different distances from the seed source were recorded, and ground cover was measured as an environmental factor influencing the invasion process. A comparative analysis was also conducted between the situation in Chile and other countries affected by P. contorta invasion. In Chile, P. contorta regeneration is significantly influenced by distance from the seed source. Higher densities are found close to the parent stand (up to 13,222 trees ha−1), decreasing as distance from the seed source increases. Age and height structure indicate that the invasion process is at an early stage, and this offers a unique opportunity to study the process of invasion and to monitor it over time. In order to preserve the distinctiveness of Patagonian ecosystem, decisive action is required to control invasive conifers, with P. contorta as the number one priority. Relative to control, there is much that can be learnt from the experiences of other countries, such as New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Questions: Do invasions of P. halepensis (Aleppo pine) from plantations into adjacent natural communities occur in the Mediterranean region, where the species is native? What are the spatio-temporal processes involved in pine invasions in contrasting Mediterranean and semi-arid climatic regions? Location: Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel. Methods: The density of invading Pinus was measured in relation to the distance from the plantation edge. Plants were categorized by age, height, basal stem girth and developmental stage, their spatial distribution was also recorded. Results: Analysis of plant age distribution indicates that the invasion process started when the plantations were 20–25 years old. Most invading plants were found within 20 m from the plantation edge, but a few individuals reached distances up to 100 m and became new invasion foci. Plant density declined sharply with distance from adult trees, data showing a better fit to a power model than to a negative exponential model. Invading Pinus began to produce cones earlier in the semi-arid than in the Mediterranean region (9 vs 12 years to 50\% reproductive plants). In both regions, higher densities of invading plants were found on the west side of the plantation, the opposite direction to the hot winds that prevail during seed release. Conclusion: The frontal advance of P. halepensis from plantations is relatively slow, but the populations also expand by a saltation process, creating spreading ‘islands’ of pine trees in the natural vegetation. Spatial pattern of recruits with distance from the source population was remarkably similar to the pattern of seed dispersal in the same region (Nathan et al. 1999). This implies that the probability of a dispersed seed developing into a plant is independent of the distance from the forest edge.},

  abstract = {With a simple model, I show that comparisons of invasibility between regions are impossible to make unless one can control for all of the variables besides invasibility that influence exotic richness, including the rates of immigration of species and the characteristics of the invading species themselves. Using data from the literature for 184 sites around the world, I found that nature reserves had one-half of the exotic fraction of sites outside reserves, and island sites had nearly three times the exotic fraction of mainland sites. However, the exotic fraction and the number of exotics were also dependent on site area, and this had to be taken into account to make valid comparisons between sites. The number of native species was used as a surrogate for site area and habitat diversity. Nearly 70\% of the variation in the number of exotic species was accounted for by a multiple regression containing the following predictors: the number of native species, whether the site was an island or on the mainland, and whether or not it was a nature reserve. After controlling for scale, there were significant differences among biomes, but not continents, in their level of invasion. Multiple biome regions and temperate agricultural or urban sites were among the most invaded biomes, and deserts and savannas were among the least. However, there was considerable within-group variation in the mean degree of invasion. Scale-controlled analysis also showed that the New World is significantly more invaded than the Old World, but only when site native richness (probably a surrogate for habitat diversity) is factored out. Contrary to expectation, communities richer in native species had more, not fewer, exotics. For mainland sites, the degree of invasion increased with latitude, but there was no such relationship for islands. Although islands are more invaded than mainland sites, this is apparently not because of low native species richness, as the islands in this data set were no less rich in native species than were mainland sites of similar area. The number of exotic species in nature reserves increases with the number of visitors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about relative invasibility, invasion potential, or the roles of dispersal and disturbance from any of these results. Most of the observed patterns here and in the literature could potentially be explained by differences between regions in species properties, ecosystem properties, or propagule pressure.},

  abstract = {The severity and spatial extent of bark-beetle outbreaks substantially increased in recent decades worldwide. The ongoing controversy about natural forest recovery after these outbreaks highlights the need for individual-based long-term studies, which disentangle processes driving forest regeneration. However, such studies have been lacking. To fill this gap, we followed the fates of 2,552 individual seedlings for 12 years after a large-scale bark-beetle outbreak that caused complete canopy dieback in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southeast Germany. We explore the contribution of advance, disturbance-related, and post-disturbance regeneration to forest recovery. Most seedlings originated directly within the three-year dieback of canopy trees induced by bark-beetle outbreak. After complete canopy dieback, the establishment of new seedlings was minimal. Surprisingly, advance regeneration formed only a minor part of all regeneration. However, because it had the highest survival rate, its importance increased over time. The most important factor influencing the survival of seedlings after disturbance was their height. Survival was further modified by microsite: seedlings established on dead wood survived best, whereas almost all seedlings surrounded by graminoids died. For 5 cm tall seedlings, annual mortality ranged from 20 to 50\% according to the rooting microsite. However, for seedlings taller than 50 cm, annual mortality was below 5\% at all microsites. While microsite modified seedling mortality, it did not affect seedling height growth. A model of regeneration dynamics based on short-term observations accurately predicts regeneration height growth, but substantially underestimates mortality rate, thus predicting more surviving seedlings than were observed. We found that P. abies forests were able to regenerate naturally even after severe bark-beetle outbreaks owing to advance and particularly disturbance-related regeneration. This, together with microsite-specific mortality, yields structurally and spatially diverse forests. Our study thus highlights the so far unrecognized importance of disturbance-related regeneration for stand recovery after bark-beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are a key intervention for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. A major challenge for PAs is the control of invasive non-native plants that spread into PAs from surrounding sources such as forestry plantations. The links between invasions and different source populations are poorly understood, making it difficult to apportion responsibilities for control costs. We estimated the effect of plantations of invasive pines (Pinus species) on the spread of these trees into PAs in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR). We assessed the effect of (i) distance from plantation, (ii) plantation and PA orientation in relation to the prevailing wind and (iii) the proportionate size of the surrounding plantation on the abundance of invasions in PAs. We also estimated the historic and potential future costs of controlling invasions in the PAs. PA management units within 3 km of a plantation had over double the pine cover of control units {$>$}6 km from plantations (6·12\% vs. 2·39\%). We attributed 51\% of the pine invasions in PAs to plantations. Neither the proportional size of the plantations nor their orientation relative to prevailing winds had a detectable effect on the cover of invasive pines. Costs of controlling invasive pines in the study area totalled 98 million Rand (10 Rand = c. 1 US\$ in 2013) between 2001 and 2012. It could cost between 273 and 916 million Rand (all future costs expressed in 2013 Rand), and take between 34 and 113 years, to clear the remaining invasive pines in the study area, depending on rates of spread and the cost–effectiveness of control. Policy implications. Estimating the contribution of an invasion source, in this case forestry plantations, requires estimating an unobservable counterfactual outcome: the invasions that would have occurred in the absence of the plantations. We have made a first step towards doing this by using empirical approaches that vary in the strictness of their assumptions, along with robustness tests to that assess the plausibility of these assumptions. Our study provides the starting point for estimating the contribution of plantation forestry to protected area invasions in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.},

When disturbance regimes change, historical processes may influence future community structure, for example, by altering invasibility compared to communities with stable regimes. Here, we use an annual plant model to investigate how the history of disturbance alters invasion success. In particular, we show how two communities can have different outcomes from species introduction, solely due to past differences in disturbance regimes that generated different biotic legacies. We demonstrate that historical differences can enhance or suppress the persistence of introduced species, and that biotic legacies generated by stable disturbance history decay over time, though legacies can persist for unexpectedly long durations. This establishes a formal theoretical foundation for disturbance legacies having profound effects on communities, and highlights the value of further research on the biotic legacies of disturbance.},

  abstract = {Many species in the family Pinaceae are invaders. These species are relatively easy to control because of some of their intrinsic characteristics and because they are highly visible and easy to eliminate. Many Pinaceae species have been well studied because of their use in forestry and their invasive behavior in many countries. The impacts of invasive Pinaceae are not only ecological, but also economic and social. We review the ecology and management of Pinaceae invasions and explore how restoration of invaded areas should be addressed. There are many ways to prevent invasions and to deal with them. Planting less invasive species, better site selection, and invasion monitoring are used successfully in different parts of the world to prevent invasion. Mechanical and chemical methods are used effectively to control Pinaceae invasions. Control is more effective at the early stages of invasion. Old invasions are more problematic as their elimination is more expensive, and the restoration of native vegetation is challenging. In some areas, native vegetation cannot thrive after Pinaceae have been removed, and weeds colonize cleared areas. More attention is needed to prevent the initiation and spread of invasions by focusing control interventions at early stages of invasion. Finding new ways of dealing sustainably with conflicts of interest between foresters and conservationists is crucial. Non-native Pinaceae are important parts of the economies and landscapes in several countries and they will continue to play such a role in the future. Despite the numerous challenges facing Pinaceae invasion management, several approaches can be successful at controlling them. Proper application of current techniques and development of more efficient ones is needed if the goal of maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts is to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Intentionally allowing or promoting invasion by non-native trees into areas characterized by treeless vegetation could contribute to climate-change mitigation by increasing carbon (C) sequestration. In some areas of the world, incentives exist to retain invasive non-native trees in natural systems as a mechanism for increasing ecosystem C storage and reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Although this novel opportunity for C sequestration holds appeal, such an approach is problematic for several reasons: (1) invasive trees do not always increase net C sequestration due to greater occurrence of fire or reduced soil C; (2) lower albedo in invaded areas can increase absorption of solar radiation, thereby offsetting potential C sequestration; and (3) tree invasions often also have negative effects on biodiversity, economic opportunities, and water yield. Such drawbacks are sufficient to raise doubts about the widespread use of non-native tree invasions in treeless areas as a tool to ameliorate climate change.},

A better understanding is important to ensure appropriate forest management in the face of climate change and increasing demand for wood products. Here, we have reviewed 75 biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, forest management recommendations for maintaining biodiversity, timber production and carbon sequestration in Sitka spruce forests in coastal Norway compared to NW Europe. Due to more focus on non-market landscape benefits and protection sites in coastal areas, transformation of spruce plantations is common. Premature cutting of stands and shelterbelts and clearing away saplings has become the dominant management practice in Norway. Based on the extent of use in Norway, and results from biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, the quality of evidence for the prevailing practice and recommendations in coastal Norway is highly questioned. To reduce conflicts, we propose a more knowledge-based management, a broader perspective underpinning the range of afforestation goals, also including the use of alternative silvicultural methods to increase structural variation in Sitka spruce stands.},

  abstract = {Understanding biological invasions patterns and mechanisms is highly needed for forecasting and managing these processes and their negative impacts. At small scales, ecological processes driving plant invasions are expected to produce a spatially explicit pattern driven by propagule pressure and local ground heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the interplay between the intensity of seed rain, using distance to a mature plantation as a proxy, and microsite heterogeneity in the spreading of Pinus contorta in the treeless Patagonian steppe. Three one-hectare plots were located under different degrees of P. contorta invasion (Coyhaique Alto, 45° 30′S and 71° 42′W). We fitted three types of inhomogeneous Poisson models to each pine plot in an attempt for describing the observed pattern as accurately as possible: the “dispersal” models, “local ground heterogeneity” models, and “combined” models, using both types of covariates. To include the temporal axis in the invasion process, we analyzed both the pattern of young and old recruits and also of all recruits together. As hypothesized, the spatial patterns of recruited pines showed coarse scale heterogeneity. Early pine invasion spatial patterns in our Patagonian steppe site is not different from expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes taking into consideration a linear and negative dependency of pine recruit intensity on the distance to afforestations. Models including ground-cover predictors were able to describe the point pattern process only in a couple of cases but never better than dispersal models. This finding concurs with the idea that early invasions depend more on seed pressure than on the biotic and abiotic relationships seed and seedlings establish at the microsite scale. Our results show that without a timely and active management, P. contorta will invade the Patagonian steppe independently of the local ground-cover conditions.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions are a global consequence of an increasingly connected world and the rise in human population size. The numbers of invasive alien species – the subset of alien species that spread widely in areas where they are not native, affecting the environment or human livelihoods – are increasing. Synergies with other global changes are exacerbating current invasions and facilitating new ones, thereby escalating the extent and impacts of invaders. Invasions have complex and often immense long-term direct and indirect impacts. In many cases, such impacts become apparent or problematic only when invaders are well established and have large ranges. Invasive alien species break down biogeographic realms, affect native species richness and abundance, increase the risk of native species extinction, affect the genetic composition of native populations, change native animal behaviour, alter phylogenetic diversity across communities, and modify trophic networks. Many invasive alien species also change ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services by altering nutrient and contaminant cycling, hydrology, habitat structure, and disturbance regimes. These biodiversity and ecosystem impacts are accelerating and will increase further in the future. Scientific evidence has identified policy strategies to reduce future invasions, but these strategies are often insufficiently implemented. For some nations, notably Australia and New Zealand, biosecurity has become a national priority. There have been long-term successes, such as eradication of rats and cats on increasingly large islands and biological control of weeds across continental areas. However, in many countries, invasions receive little attention. Improved international cooperation is crucial to reduce the impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human livelihoods. Countries can strengthen their biosecurity regulations to implement and enforce more effective management strategies that should also address other global changes that interact with invasions.},

The period covered is from September 1957 to August 2002. The dynamic atmospheric downscaling is performed as a series of short prognostic runs initialized from a blend of ERA-40 and the previous prognostic run to preserve the fine-scale surface features from the high-resolution model while maintaining the large-scale synoptic field from ERA-40. The nested WAM wave model hindcast consists of a coarse 50 km model covering the North Atlantic forced with ERA-40 winds and a nested 10–11 km resolution model forced with downscaled winds. A comparison against in situ and satellite observations of wind and sea state reveals significant improvement in mean values and upper percentiles of wind vectors and the significant wave height over ERA-40. Improvement is also found in the mean wave period. ERA-40 is biased low in wind speed and significant wave height, a bias which is not reproduced by the downscaling. The atmospheric downscaling also reproduces polar lows, which cannot be resolved by ERA-40, but the lows are too weak and short-lived as the downscaling is not capable of capturing their full life cycle.},

Factors determining naturalization in plants 388 Acknowledgements 392 References 392 Summary The literature on biological invasions is biased in favour of invasive species – those that spread and often reach high abundance following introduction by humans. It is, however, also important to understand previous stages in the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum (‘the continuum’), especially the factors that mediate naturalization. The emphasis on invasiveness is partly because most invasions are only recognized once species occupy large adventive ranges or start to spread. Also, many studies lump all alien species, and fail to separate introduced, naturalized and invasive populations and species. These biases impede our ability to elucidate the full suite of drivers of invasion and to predict invasion dynamics, because different factors mediate progression along different sections of the continuum. A better understanding of the determinants of naturalization is important because all naturalized species are potential invaders. Processes leading to naturalization act differently in different regions and global biogeographical patterns of plant invasions result from the interaction of population-biological, macroecological and human-induced factors. We explore what is known about how determinants of naturalization in plants interact at various scales, and how their importance varies along the continuum. Research that is explicitly linked to particular stages of the continuum can generate new information that is appropriate for improving the management of biological invasions if, for example, potentially invasive species are identified before they exert an impact.},

  abstract = {Many factors interact to determine whether an introduced organism will become invasive. The widespread planting of many Pinus species at various densities and in many habitats at different times in the Southern Hemisphere (well outside their natural range) provides a unique opportunity to identify the determinants of invasive success for a large group of related organisms. At least sixteen pine species have spread from planting sites to invade natural or semi-natural vegetation. Species with adventive populations over fairly large areas are P. contorta Dougl., P. halepensis Mill., P. patula Schiede \& Deppe, P. pinaster Ait., P. ponderosa Laws., P. radiata D. Don and P. sylvestris L. This paper explores the biological profiles of successful invaders, the inherent and induced susceptibility of different vegetation types to invasion, patterns of invasion, the role of disturbance in initiating and sustaining invasions, the role of time, and the various functions of the resident biota in the receiving habitat in mediating the outcome of an introduction. This information, with evidence from contemporary studies of pine dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere and reconstructions of pine migrations in the early Holocene, shows that: (1) Most of the important invaders share a suite of biological traits that facilitate long-distance dispersal by wind, and allow invading populations to persist in habitats subjected to frequent disturbance. (2) The extent of invasion for widely planted species is positively correlated with the residence period. (3) Ground-cover categories can be ranked according to their vulnerability to invasion as follows: forest {$<$} shrubland {$<$} grassland {$<<$} dunes {$<$} bare ground. (4) Distribance regimes and the resident biota have a marked (and complex) influence on invadability. This information is used to predict future trends in pine invasions.},

The role of propagule pressure relative to disturbance and various environmental factors is, however, difficult to quantify. We explored the relative importance of factors driving invasions using detailed data on the distribution and percentage cover of alien tree species on South Africa’s Agulhas Plain (2,160 km2). Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster). A semimechanistic model was then developed to quantify the roles of propagule pressure and environmental heterogeneity in structuring invasion patterns. The intensity of propagule pressure (approximated by the distance from putative invasion foci) was a much better predictor of canopy cover than any environmental factor that was considered. The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors. The mediating effect of environmental factors was species specific. Models combining propagule pressure and environmental factors successfully predicted more than 70\% of the variation in canopy cover for each species.},

  abstract = {Robinia pseudoacacia L. (black locust) is a North American tree, considered controversial because of the conflict between multiple uses by humans and negative environmental impacts, which have resulted in it being listed among the most invasive species in Europe. The current management of Robinia stands in Central Europe varies locally according to national legislation, preferring either socio-economic benefits or biodiversity impacts. We collected field data from our target region of Czechia, reviewed research articles including local grey literature mostly from Central and Southern Europe, unpublished results of local projects and inquired relevant specialists. Because Robinia grows in habitats ranging from urban to forest to natural grassland, neither unrestricted cultivation nor large-scale eradication is applicable as a universal practice. In this paper we suggest a complex management strategy for Robinia stands that takes into account habitat, this species’ local ability to spread, as well as economic, cultural and biodiversity aspects. We categorized Robinia stands growing in Europe into eight groups and proposed stratified approach to the management based on decisions that reflect local context. Depending on that, the management includes (i) establishment of new plantations, (ii) maintenance or utilization of existing stands, (iii) tolerance and (iv) conversion to original vegetation. Our complex management strategy will provide a comprehensive guideline for the management of alien trees in Europe.},

  abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Seed dispersal distance-a key process in plant population dynamics-remains poorly understood because of the difficulty of finding a source plant so well isolated from conspecifics that seeds or seedlings can be unambiguously attributed to it. Inverse modeling (IM) of seed dispersal, a simple statistical technique for parameterizing dispersal kernels, has been widely used since 1992; surprisingly, however, this approach has never been verified in the field. METHODS: We released from 20 nearby trees the winged seeds of a liana species, Entada polystachya, near the coast in a tropical, dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. KEY RESULTS: With a two-parameter log-normal function, we found that IM predicted both the shape and scale parameters well as long as we used the entire data set. When, however, we subsampled (thus simulating the use of transects for seedlings or an array of seed traps), the estimates of the scale and shape parameters were often more than double the real values. The problem was due to the marked anisotropy (directional bias; in this case, in the direction of the diurnal sea breeze) of the individual dispersal curves. When we randomized the direction of dispersal of individual seeds from the trees (keeping dispersal distances unchanged), predictions of parameter values were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Inverse modeling must include directional parameters when dealing with areas where strong anisotropy is to be expected, e.g., for wind dispersal of seeds near coasts or pollination by any vector where a plant species is limited to a strongly linear habitat such as river banks.},

The threshold values for all criteria are numerically defined, rendering the set of criteria fully quantitative. Genericity is ensured by using criteria that are applicable to all taxonomic groups and in all habitats. In being generic, quantitative, ecological and normatively neutral, the criteria were inspired by the international Red List criteria. Capturing both invasion potential and effect, GEIAA can be regarded as a full ecological impact assessment. The assessment procedure contains guidelines on documentation, the collection of background information, the handling of uncertainty, and quality assurance. GEIAA represents the second revision, and thus the third generation, of assessment methodology in Norway.

Recognising that plantation silviculture today is no longer largely a question of how to grow large-scale industrial plantations, the authors have included chapters describing other, more diverse reasons for establishing trees. Forestry practices are set in the context of the science behind them and their environmental, social and policy frameworks. Concise and clear, this will be essential reading for forestry students and professionals alike. - ;As pressures to preserve natural forest resources have increased, plantation forestry and its study have gained in importance. Plantation Silviculture in Europe is an up-to-date, timely, and comprehensive exploration of the principles that underlie the planting and maintaining of forest resources. Based on the excellent reception of Savill and Evans\&\#39; Plantation Silviculture in Temperate Regions (OUP, 1986), which was largely UK-based, the inclusion of two European authors ensures that the scope of this new book extends across the entire continent. Plantation Silviculture in Europe provides a thorough overview of the central aspects of conventional plantation forestry, covering site preparation, choice of species, establishment and maintenance, nutrition, spacing, thinning and pruning, and protection. In addition, it acknowledges the changing emphasis and increasing diversity of contemporary forestry, and includes chapters on community woodlands, urban forests, plantings for amenity and sport, and energy crops. Throughout, an attempt is made to set practices in the context of the ecological and biological forest processes which underpin them. Plantation Silviculture also incorporates discussion of the many environmental, social and policy issues that surround forestry today. Concise and clearly written, this will be essential reading for graduate and undergraduate forestry students and forestry professionals alike. Likely to become the standard text throughout Europe, it also contains much material of relevance to foresters in North America, East Asia, and Australasia. -},

  abstract = {Effective seed dispersal, combining both dispersal and postdispersal (establishment) processes, determines population dynamics and colonization ability in plants. According to the Janzen–Connell (JC) model, high mortality near the mother plant shifts the offspring establishment distribution farther away from the mother plant relative to the seed dispersal distribution. Yet, extending this prediction to the distribution of mature (reproductive) offspring remains a challenge for long-living plants. To address this challenge, we selected an isolated natural Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) population in Mt. Pithulim (Israel), which expanded from five ancestor trees in the beginning of the 20th century into ∼2000 trees today. Using nine microsatellite markers, we assigned parents to trees established during the early stages of population expansion. To elucidate the effect of the distance from the mother plant on postdispersal survival, we compared the effective seed dispersal kernel, based on the distribution of mother–offspring distances, with the seed dispersal kernel, based on simulations of a mechanistic wind dispersal model. We found that the mode of the effective dispersal kernel is shifted farther away than the mode of the seed dispersal kernel, reflecting increased survival with increasing distance from the mother plant. The parentage analysis demonstrated a highly skewed reproductive success and a strong directionality in effective dispersal corresponding to the wind regime. We thus provide compelling evidence that JC effects act also on offspring that become reproductive and persist as adults for many decades, a key requirement in assessing the role of postdispersal processes in shaping population and community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Aim To determine biotic and abiotic controls on pine invasion globally within six ecoregions that include both introduced and native ranges. Locations Río Negro province, Argentina; Aysén and Araucanía regions, Chile; South Island (two ecoregions), New Zealand; Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, USA. Methods We quantified tree abundance and size across invasion fronts of the widespread invasive tree species Pinus contorta at each of the nine sites, encompassing both the native and introduced range. We also determined the relative importance of propagule pressure, abiotic characteristics and biotic factors for invasion success. Finally, key plant population metrics such as individual tree growth rates and reproductive effort were compared between native and introduced ranges. Results Pinus contorta density decreased with increasing distance from source population in all cases, but the importance and shape of this relationship differed among sites due, primarily to biotic factors. For example, areas dominated by native southern beech forest (Fuscospora cliffortioides or Nothofagus spp.) were not invaded, and this biotic resistance was not overcome by high propagule pressure. In contrast, shrublands were more highly invaded than grasslands, contradicting previous generalizations about pine invasions. Pinus contorta growth was faster, age to maturity was earlier and reproductive effort was higher in the introduced ranges compared with the native range, suggesting a demographic shift towards more rapid population growth in introduced regions. Climatic differences between the ranges may explain, at least in part, the observed pattern. Main conclusions We demonstrate that although biological invasions are driven by propagule pressure across different ecoregions, these processes interact strongly with biotic factors. Intriguingly, our results suggest that propagule pressure may become less important than biotic interactions as invasions proceed. Multi-region studies including both the native and introduced ranges provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding how these interactions change among regions as invasions proceed.},

In order to better understand how tree species’ distributions may change in response to anticipated climate change, more knowledge of the effects of complex climate and biotic interactions is needed. We conducted a seed-sowing experiment to investigate how temperature, precipitation and biotic interactions impact recruitment of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings in southern Norway. Seeds were sown into intact vegetation and experimentally created gaps. To study the combined effects of temperature and precipitation, the experiment was replicated across 12 sites, spanning a natural climate gradient from boreal to alpine and from sub-continental to oceanic. Seedling emergence and survival were assessed 12 and 16~months after sowing, respectively, and above-ground biomass and height were determined at the end of the experiment. Interestingly, very few seedlings were detected in the boreal sites, and the highest number of seedlings emerged and established in the alpine sites, indicating that low temperature did not limit seedling recruitment. Site precipitation had an overall positive effect on seedling recruitment, especially at intermediate precipitation levels. Seedling emergence, establishment and biomass were higher in gap plots compared to intact vegetation at all temperature levels. These results suggest that biotic interactions in the form of competition may be more important than temperature as a limiting factor for tree seedling recruitment in the sub- and low-alpine zone of southern Norway.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal is the main movement mechanism used by plants. The last decade saw rapid progress in understanding the underlying processes, especially for dispersal by wind, in part due to new mechanistic modeling approaches that account for turbulent fluctuations. Yet, current wind dispersal models stop short of explicitly incorporating the effects of landscape topography on the main transporting vector – wind, so that the effects of wind variability over hills on dispersal patterns remain by and large unstudied. A new mechanistic model was developed that combines Eulerian wind statistics derived from a simplified analytical approach of flow over gently sloped forested hills with a Lagrangian seed trajectory model. Model runs were used to explore the effects of seed release location along the hill on dispersal kernels predicted by the new model in relation to their flat-terrain counterparts. The model was parameterized for a Pinus taeda plantation, and a range of seed motion capacities represented by terminal velocity and release height, and realistic topographic variation were then explored. To evaluate model performance, computed kernels were compared to kernel measurements collected in a large flume for spherical ‘seeds’ released near the top of a rod canopy covering gentle cosine hills. The evaluation showed that the model reproduced the key experimental differences in dispersal patterns for releases at the hill crest and bottom. The simulations revealed several novel findings. For seeds released within the canopy, both median and 99th percentile dispersal distances on the hill upwind side were up to two times longer than on flat terrain for the same motion capacity. Seeds released on the lee side traveled mostly toward the hill crest – following the local within-the-canopy wind direction. This direction was contrary to the ‘regional’ wind direction set by the flow conditions above the canopy. There, the directionality of the long-distance dispersal was additionally dependent on uplifting probability, affected by seed motion capacity. It was demonstrated that neglecting the effects of even gentle topography in mechanistic seed dispersal models can lead to biased estimates of dispersal distances and directionality on hilly terrain. These results are pertinent to plant population demography, connectivity and spread on hills. More broadly, the approach developed here can be extended to movement of pollen and various airborne organisms over hills.},

  abstract = {In a north European context, identifying invasive species is far from trivial because the vegetation has been influenced by human activities for thousands of years. New species have immigrated continuously since the end of the last glaciation, both spontaneously and through direct or indirect help by man. Still, newly immigrated species may be problematic in a nature conservation context and may harm biodiversity, and cause changes in ecosystem services. In this study, all 721 presently established vascular plant and bryophyte taxa known to have been introduced to, or to have immigrated to, Sweden since the year 1700 are assessed for their invasive potential. The assessment is based on six components considered relevant for their invasiveness: 1) ability to compete in natural vegetation, 2) ability to form dense populations, 3) realized dispersal ability, 4) gene flow to native relatives, 5) time since immigration and 6) distance to their native range. Although the relative importance of these components is context dependent, a compound general index of invasive concern is proposed and calculated for all taxa. The index of invasive concern is validated by comparing it to assessments by a Bayesian Belief Network in which the influences of the same six components are assigned by expert opinions. In addition, rough estimates of the present-day abundance of each taxon in Sweden are presented. The origin, biology and possible impact of the 150 taxa with the highest index values are discussed. Based on the index of invasive concern, Campylopus introflexus, Epilobium adenocaulon, E. ciliatum, Rosa rugosa, Lamiastrum galeobdolon subsp. argentatum, Orthodontium lineare, Solidago canadensis, Calystegia sepium subsp. spectabilis, Rubus armeniacus and Prunus serotina are identified as the ten most problematic alien vascular plant and bryophyte taxa in Sweden.},

  abstract = {Pinus pinaster is a common plantation species in many Mediterranean-climate regions of the world and has become invasive in several of these, but little is known about its invasive potential, with no studies regarding its invasion potential and patterns being carried out in Australia. It has been widely planted over many decades in the Perth region of southwest Australia. Here we used plots to measure the density, size and approximate age of P. pinaster wildings in native vegetation adjacent to pine plantations and in areas of cleared plantations. Results demonstrated that densities of P. pinaster wildings were highest at edges and varied widely with vegetation type, being much greater in dense, wetland vegetation compared to more open sclerophyllous woodlands, which was contrary to that experienced in other regions. Wilding regeneration following clearing was also highly variable. Local populations of black cockatoos, which fell cones to ground for feeding, are likely to have contributed to low levels of spread into native bushland by curtailing wind dispersal of seeds from tree canopies, as well as providing an ample seed source for regeneration of wildings at cleared sites. Wildfires, which can lead to mass regeneration of P. pinaster elsewhere, did not promote spread of wildings into adjoining bushland, but did enhance wilding densities in wetland vegetation within the plantation matrix.},

  abstract = {Over 430 alien tree species worldwide are known to be invasive, and the list is growing as more tree species are moved around the world and become established in novel environments. Alien trees can simultaneously bring many benefits and cause substantial environmental harm, very often leading to conflicts over how they should be managed. The impacts grow over time as invasions spread, and societal perceptions of the value of alien trees also change as understanding grows and as values shift. This leads to a dynamic environment in which trade-offs are required to maximise benefits and minimise harm. The management of alien tree populations needs to be strategic and adaptive, combining all possible management interventions to promote the sustainable delivery of optimal outcomes. We use examples, mainly from South Africa (where issues relating to invasive alien trees introduced for forestry have received most attention), to argue for holistic and collaborative approaches to alien tree management. Such approaches need to include bold steps, such as phasing out unsustainable plantation forestry that is based on highly invasive species, and in which the costs are externalised. Furthermore, it would be advisable to impose much stricter controls on the introduction of alien trees to new environments, so that problems that would arise from subsequent invasions can be avoided.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms behind population and community responses to edge effects. However, functional responses remain poorly explored. Seed dispersal is a key process in ecosystem functioning, and edge effects may alter patterns of seed dispersal through changes in dispersers’ behavior and environmental conditions. Here, we test predictive models of edge effects and habitat suitability on seed dispersal by considering different scenarios given by differences in the dispersal agent (wind and vertebrate dispersal), and the contrast between habitats of native southern Atlantic forest and tree plantations that occur across the entire area of influence of the edge. We fit our data to non-linear theoretical models to explore the response of seed rain to three general patterns of response to edge effects and differences on habitat suitability: (1) monotonic (sigmoid or exponential) (seed rain is higher in one of the habitats), (2) unimodal (seed rain shows either a maximum or a minimum near the edge, with or without differences on habitat suitability between adjacent habitats) and (3) neutral response (seed rain is constant across the ecotone). We estimated abundance and richness of wind- and vertebrate-dispersed seeds using seed traps, and measured vegetation structure in four different edges between native forest and tree plantations (from recent to mature plantations). Edge effects affected seed rain patterns depending on both the degree of vegetation contrast between habitats and the dispersal agent. Wind-dispersed seeds showed a monotonic response to most edges, whereas responses of vertebrate-dispersed seeds varied among edges (monotonic, unimodal and neutral), consistent with the dispersers’ behavior. High contrast edges (forest-recent plantation) showed unimodal edge response, while those created by low contrast edges (forest-mature plantation) exhibited monotonic responses (sigmoid). Differences on habitat suitability on vertebrate-dispersed seeds increased with edge contrast, while richness and abundance of vertebrate-dispersed seeds in the habitat interior showed the opposite pattern. The abundance of wind-dispersed seeds inside the studied habitats increased with edge contrast. The current analytical framework developed to explore responses of populations and communities to edge effects successfully described the response of seed dispersal. Furthermore, edge effects affected seed dispersal patterns differently depending on the dispersal agent and the contrast between habitats. Our findings contribute to the understanding of forest regeneration processes and may help increase the effectiveness of restoration efforts.},

In the present study, we examined functional patterns of seed dispersal between the native forest and tree plantations with different degrees of contrast. We expected that the movement of seeds between the native forest and plantations would depend on the degree of edge contrast, the dispersal syndrome, and the size/weight of seeds. We sampled the seed rain by using seed traps, and measured vegetation structure in the ecotone between four different plantations and the native forest (300\,m inside both the native forest and the plantations) in the Atlantic forest of Argentina during a 12-month period. We weighed wind-dispersed seeds and measured vertebrate-dispersed seeds. Edge effects acted as a filter for seed size/weight of both vertebrate- and wind-dispersed seeds. The abundance and functional diversity of seeds arriving at tree plantations increased with plantation age; large seeds were more sensitive to habitat disturbance than small seeds, independently of the dispersal syndrome. Our results highlight that seed movements between the native forest and human-created habitats largely depend on the interaction between dispersal syndrome, seed size, distance to the edge and habitat contrast. Our results also showed that long-term plantation cycles will increase the functional diversity of seeds in the seed bank and facilitate the regeneration of the native vegetation, and that small mature stands close to the native forest will largely facilitate the arrival of seeds and increase the suitability for native fauna.},

  abstract = {Sets of presence records used to model species’ distributions typically consist of observations collected opportunistically rather than systematically. As a result, sampling probability is geographically uneven, which may confound the model's characterization of the species’ distribution. Modelers frequently address sampling bias by manipulating training data: either subsampling presence data or creating a similar spatial bias in non-presence background data. We tested a new method, which we call ‘background thickening’, in the latter category. Background thickening entails concentrating background locations around presence locations in proportion to presence location density. We compared background thickening to two established sampling bias correction methods – target group background selection and presence thinning – using simulated data and data from a case study. In the case study, background thickening and presence thinning performed similarly well, both producing better model discrimination than target group background selection, and better model calibration than models without correction. In the simulation, background thickening performed better than presence thinning when the number of simulated presence locations was low, and vice versa. We discuss drawbacks to target group background selection, why background thickening and presence thinning are conservative but robust sampling bias correction methods, and why background thickening is better than presence thinning for small sample sizes. Particularly, background thickening is advantageous for treating sampling bias when data are scarce because it avoids discarding presence records.},

  abstract = {Selective pressures that influence the form of seed dispersal syndromes are poorly understood. Morphology of plant propagules is often used to infer the means of dispersal, but morphology can be misleading. Several species of pines, for example, have winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal but owe much of their establishment to scatter-hoarding animals. Here the relative importance of wind vs. animal dispersal is assessed for four species of pines of the eastern Sierra Nevada that have winged seeds but differed in seed size: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta murrayana, 8 mg); ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa ponderosa, 56 mg); Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi, 160 mg); and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana, 231 mg). Pre-dispersal seed mortality eliminated much of the ponderosa pine seed crop (66\%), but had much less effect on Jeffrey pine (32\% of seeds destroyed), lodgepole pine (29\%), and sugar pine (7\%). When cones opened most filled seeds were dispersed by wind. Animals removed {$>$}99\% of wind-dispersed Jeffrey and sugar pine seeds from the ground within 60 days, but animals gathered only 93\% of lodgepole pine seeds and 38\% of ponderosa pine seeds during the same period. Animals gathered and scatter hoarded radioactively labeled ponderosa, Jeffrey, and sugar pine seeds, making a total of 2103 caches over three years of study. Only three lodgepole pine caches were found. Caches typically contained 1–4 seeds buried 5–20 mm deep, depths suitable for seedling emergence. Although Jeffrey and sugar pine seeds are initially wind dispersed, nearly all seedlings arise from animal caches. Lodgepole pine is almost exclusively wind dispersed, with animals acting as seed predators. Animals treated ponderosa pine in an intermediate fashion. Two-phased dispersal of large, winged pine seeds appears adaptive; initial wind dispersal helps to minimize pre-dispersal seed mortality whereas scatter hoarding by animals places seeds in sites with a higher probability of seedling establishment.},

  abstract = {Pines (genus Pinus) are cultivated extensively for forestry purposes, particularly in regions that are outside the genus’ native range. The most common forestry species are also typically those most likely to escape cultivation and spread rapidly, and thus pines constitute a substantial weed problem in many regions. However, there is limited knowledge of the factors underlying the spread of pines from plantations. Assessments across heterogeneous landscapes are required to provide rigorous data to support management tools and policies aiming to protect vulnerable ecosystems from pine invasions. We examined the spread of Pinus radiata from forestry plantations over a 9,000 km2 landscape on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. We used ground-based surveys from a set of viewpoints to determine tree locations, coupled with geographic information system (GIS) viewsheds to define the area surveyed. We used boosted regression trees to build a habitat model for P. radiata establishment on Banks Peninsula. We surveyed an area approximately 107 km2, recording 470 naturally established P. radiata individuals. Our habitat models suggested that proximity to the nearest plantation forest was the most important variable predicting P. radiata establishment, with individuals most likely to establish within 150 m of a plantation. Individuals were also most likely to establish in early successional shrub communities, proximate to roads, and on steeper topography. Highly grazed habitats were least vulnerable to P. radiata establishment. The slope and aspect of the source plantation influenced the distances from the plantation at which P. radiata individuals were recorded, with individuals recorded furthest away likely to have originated from plantations that were south-facing or on steeper slopes, and therefore most exposed to strong winds. Synthesis and applications. Our findings on distances from plantations at which individuals established, vulnerable habitats, and the interactions we detected among our predictor variables, can be extended to aid management of non-native conifer plantings elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. These data can be used to contribute to improvements of decision support systems that assess likely spread risk from non-native conifer plantings. Such tools can reduce the likelihood of future pine establishment, potentially preventing biological invasions.},

However, cases of introduced organisms that failed to invade are reported in many instances as anecdotes or are simply ignored. In this analysis, we aimed to find common characteristics between non-invasive populations of known invasive species and evaluated how the study of failed invasions can contribute to research on biological invasions. We found intraspecific variation in invasion success and several recurring explanations for why non-native species fail to invade; these included low propagule pressure, abiotic resistance, biotic resistance, genetic constraints and mutualist release. Furthermore, we identified key research topics where ignoring failed invasions could produce misleading results; these include studies on historical factors associated with invasions, distribution models of invasive species, the effect of species traits on invasiveness, genetic effects, biotic resistance and habitat invasibility. In conclusion, we found failed invasions can provide fundamental information on the relative importance of factors determining invasions and might be a key component of several research topics. Therefore, our analysis suggests that more specific and detailed studies on invasion failures are necessary.},
