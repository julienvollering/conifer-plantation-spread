  abstract = {1 In many places in Europe, trees are currently far below their theoretical altitudinal limit because of past land use. However, under the current crisis affecting mountain agriculture, trees are likely to recolonize the subalpine belt. Addressing the societal issues associated with such landscape change requires predictive tools to assess vegetation dynamics in relation to management strategies. This study aims to analyse the factors determining tree dynamics at the subalpine ecotone and to evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape vegetation patterns. 2 We developed a hierarchical scaling approach and applied it to a European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) colonization in the French Alps. Our landscape case study focused on subalpine south-facing grasslands of Villar d'Ar\^ene (France). First, we used a habitat-suitability model to delineate the climatic suitability habitats of larch in the French Alps. Then we used a landscape model (LaMoS) to determine whether larch is able to colonize these grasslands predicted to be climatically suitable, considering land use and local vegetation. The sensitivity of landscape colonization patterns to land-use scenarios (abandonment, delayed mowing or traditional mowing) and biological attributes of larch were analysed with a factorial simulation experiment. 3 The accuracy of the habitat-suitability model at the French Alps scale allowed for the prediction that the grasslands of Villar d'Ar\^ene were highly suitable for larch. 4 Simulations highlighted the effect of land use on larch establishment at the local but not at the landscape scale. On the other hand, larch attributes such as dispersal capacity, juvenile tolerance to light interaction (competition and facilitation) and its capacity to survive on infertile soil were shown as essential for tree spatial dynamics. 5 Synthesis and applications. Combining a habitat-suitability model with a spatially and temporally explicit landscape model enhances the capacity to account for environmental factors acting at different overlapping scales. This modelling strategy increases the robustness and accuracy of predictions, a prerequisite for landscape management in a global change context. We conclude that ongoing and future agri-environmental policies have to be quickly adapted to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by subalpine grasslands.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is essential for species to survive the threats of habitat destruction and climate change. Combining descriptions of dispersal ability with those of landscape structure, the concept of functional connectivity has been popular for understanding and predicting species' spatial responses to environmental change. Following recent advances, the functional connectivity concept is now able to move beyond landscape structure to consider more explicitly how other external factors such as climate and resources affect species movement. We argue that these factors, in addition to a consideration of the complete dispersal process, are critical for an accurate understanding of functional connectivity for plant species in response to environmental change. We use recent advances in dispersal, landscape and molecular ecology to describe how a range of external factors can influence effective dispersal in plant species, and how the resulting functional connectivity can be assessed. Synthesis. We define plant functional connectivity as the effective dispersal of propagules or pollen among habitat patches in a landscape. Plant functional connectivity is determined by a combination of landscape structure, interactions between plant, environment and dispersal vectors, and the successful establishment of individuals. We hope that this consolidation of recent research will help focus future connectivity research and conservation.},

To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and land-cover types. Location The mainland of Norway. Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain size) of 1 \texttimes{} 1, 5 \texttimes{} 5 and 10 \texttimes{} 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of these. Results The first four principal components explained between 75\% and 85\% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance: (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4) topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1\textendash 3). The first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions: vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine). Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of bioclimatic regional vegetation variation in Norway, provide an explicit characterization of this variation in terms of climatic variables, and show that environmental variability can be reproduced as GIS layers in step-less models. These models have the potential to become important tools for future predictive modelling within resource management, conservation planning and biogeographical (and other ecological) research.},

In this review, we propose a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions. The unified framework combines previous stage-based and barrier models, and provides a terminology and categorisation for populations at different points in the invasion process.},

  abstract = {Zeros (i.e. events that do not happen) are the source of two common phenomena in count data: overdispersion and zero-inflation. Zeros have multiple origins in a dataset: false zeros occur due to errors in the experimental design or the observer; structural zeros are related to the ecological or evolutionary restrictions of the system under study; and random zeros are the result of the sampling variability. Identifying the type of zeros and their relation with overdispersion and/or zero inflation is key to select the most appropriate statistical model. Here we review the different modelling options in relation to the presence of overdispersion and zero inflation, tested through the dispersion and zero inflation indices. We then examine the theory of the zero-inflated (ZI) models and the use of the score tests to assess overdispersion and zero inflation over a model. In order to choose an adequate model when analysing count data we suggest the following protocol: Step 1) classify the zeros and minimize the presence of false zeros; Step 2) identify suitable covariates; Step 3) test the data for overdispersion and zero-inflation and Step 4) choose the most adequate model based on the results of step 3 and use score tests to determine whether more complex models should be implemented. We applied the recommended protocol on a real dataset on plant\textendash herbivore interactions to evaluate the suitability of six different models (Poisson, NB and their zero-inflated versions\textemdash ZIP, ZINB). Our data were overdispersed and zero-inflated, and the ZINB was the model with the best fit, as predicted. Ignoring overdispersion and/or zero inflation during data analyses caused biased estimates of the statistical parameters and serious errors in the interpretation of the results. Our results are a clear example on how the conclusions of an ecological hypothesis can change depending on the model applied. Understanding how zeros arise in count data, for example identifying the potential sources of structural zeros, is essential to select the best statistical design. A good model not only fits the data correctly but also takes into account the idiosyncrasies of the biological system.},

However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance {$<$} mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.},

  abstract = {Sustainably managed non-native trees deliver economic and societal benefits with limited risk of spread to adjoining areas. However, some plantations have launched invasions that cause substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services, while others pose substantial threats of causing such impacts. The challenge is to maximise the benefits of non-native trees, while minimising negative impacts and preserving future benefits and options.  A workshop was held in 2019 to develop global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees, using the Council of Europe \textendash{} Bern Convention Code of Conduct on Invasive Alien Trees as a starting point.  The global guidelines consist of eight recommendations: 1) Use native trees, or non-invasive non-native trees, in preference to invasive non-native trees; 2) Be aware of and comply with international, national, and regional regulations concerning non-native trees; 3) Be aware of the risk of invasion and consider global change trends; 4) Design and adopt tailored practices for plantation site selection and silvicultural management; 5) Promote and implement early detection and rapid response programmes; 6) Design and adopt tailored practices for invasive non-native tree control, habitat restoration, and for dealing with highly modified ecosystems; 7) Engage with stakeholders on the risks posed by invasive non-native trees, the impacts caused, and the options for management; and 8) Develop and support global networks, collaborative research, and information sharing on native and non-native trees.  The global guidelines are a first step towards building global consensus on the precautions that should be taken when introducing and planting non-native trees. They are voluntary and are intended to complement statutory requirements under international and national legislation. The application of the global guidelines and the achievement of their goals will help to conserve forest biodiversity, ensure sustainable forestry, and contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations linked with forest biodiversity.},

Disturbance is often thought to favour invaders as it allows recruitment; however, the effects of disturbance are more complicated when it results in mortality of the invader. When disturbance rates in both invader occupied and unoccupied sites are the same, recruitment and mortality effects are exactly balanced, and successful invasion is independent of the disturbance regime. Differences in the disturbance rates between invader occupied and unoccupied sites can occur through invader modification or management of disturbance. Under these conditions, we found a novel mechanism for the generation of an Allee effect, which occurs when the invader promotes disturbance in sites it already occupies.

  abstract = {1 Management decisions regarding invasive plants often have to be made quickly and in the face of fragmentary knowledge of their population dynamics. However, recommendations are commonly made on the basis of only a restricted set of parameters. Without addressing uncertainty and variability in model parameters we risk ineffective management, resulting in wasted resources and an escalating problem if early chances to control spread are missed. 2 Using available data for Pinus nigra in ungrazed and grazed grassland and shrubland in New Zealand, we parameterized a stage-structured spread model to calculate invasion wave speed, population growth rate and their sensitivities and elasticities to population parameters. Uncertainty distributions of parameters were used with the model to generate confidence intervals (CI) about the model predictions. 3 Ungrazed grassland environments were most vulnerable to invasion and the highest elasticities and sensitivities of invasion speed were to long-distance dispersal parameters. However, there was overlap between the elasticity and sensitivity CI on juvenile survival, seedling establishment and long-distance dispersal parameters, indicating overlap in their effects on invasion speed. 4 While elasticity of invasion speed to long-distance dispersal was highest in shrubland environments, there was overlap with the CI of elasticity to juvenile survival. In shrubland invasion speed was most sensitive to the probability of establishment, especially when establishment was low. In the grazed environment elasticity and sensitivity of invasion speed to the severity of grazing were consistently highest. Management recommendations based on elasticities and sensitivities depend on the vulnerability of the habitat. 5 Synthesis and applications. Despite considerable uncertainty in demography and dispersal, robust management recommendations emerged from the model. Proportional or absolute reductions in long-distance dispersal, juvenile survival and seedling establishment parameters have the potential to reduce wave speed substantially. Plantations of wind-dispersed invasive conifers should not be sited on exposed sites vulnerable to long-distance dispersal events, and trees in these sites should be removed. Invasion speed can also be reduced by removing seedlings, establishing competitive shrubs and grazing. Incorporating uncertainty into the modelling process increases our confidence in the wide applicability of the management strategies recommended here.},

  abstract = {To address the lack of information about the shape and extent of real dispersal kernels, Bullock et al. (Journal of Ecology 105:6-19, 2017) synthesised empirical information on seed dispersal distances. Testing the fit of a variety of probability density functions, they found no function was the best-fitting for all datasets but some outperformed others. Cousens et al. (Journal of Ecology, 2017) focus on the specific finding of the generally poor fit of the WALD function to wind dispersal data and use this to argue that mechanistically derived functions would not be expected to fit data particularly well. We agree in part with this argument and discuss the issues that may lead to poor fit, including the simplifying assumptions of the WALD and the complexity of the dispersal process. We explain the fundamental linkage between the mechanistic form of the WALD and the derived function used for fitting to data. We demonstrate, however, that the logic that a mechanistically based function could fit to data is valid, under the hypothesis that it encompasses the key processes determining the dispersal kernel. This argument is supported by the facts that: (1) our analyses and others have shown the WALD performs well in a number of cases; and (2) the WALD is the best-fitting function for an example in which we simulate dispersal data using a realistic representation of variability in the wind dispersal process. Synthesis. While there are reasons that mechanistically derived functions may not fit well to empirical data, they do in some empirical and simulated cases and this suggests they can capture the dispersal behaviour of real systems. Mechanistic functions should be explored along with other more general functions when describing empirical data to investigate their simplifying assumptions and to add to our arsenal of functions for analysing dispersal data. Analyses using these functions are critical if we are to move from simply describing the system in which the data were gathered to gaining more general insights into dispersal and predicting its consequences.},

  abstract = {In many countries, plantation forestry depends mostly on a small number of fast-growing exotic species (mainly eucalypts and pines). These species are highly productive but may also become invasive in the communities surrounding plantations. The spread of alien species depends on characteristics of the species itself (species invasiveness) and of the host community (community invasibility), so that some habitats are more vulnerable than others to the invasion of a given species. Our aim in this study is to assess the ability of Eucalyptus globulus to spread in the absence of fire from plantations into the three most common types of surrounding habitats in the study area (NW Spain; native forests, pine plantations and shrublands) and to make recommendations to minimize the risk of spread. We independently assessed propagule pressure and community invasibility by measuring (1) the amount of seeds of E. globulus reaching different distances from the edge of plantations, and (2) seedling emergence and survival in the three types of habitats mentioned. We then estimated the density of seedling and sapling recruitment at different distances from plantation edges by means of a stochastic model parameterized with field data. Seed dispersal distances up to 80m were recorded, with the frequency distribution of dispersal distances being strongly leptokurtic. Most E. globulus seeds were recorded in the first 5m from plantation edges (84.3\%), and 98.6\% in the first 15m. Native forests were the most resistant to E. globulus spread, showing lower seedling emergence (0.9\% vs. 3.3\% and 2.2\% in shrublands and pine plantations) and survival (3.7\% vs. 17.5\% and 19.9\% up to 6months). Despite relatively low establishment success ratio, high seed production leads to considerable seedling densities in surrounding habitats, especially in pine plantations and shrublands. In order to control E. globulus spread, we recommend eliminating all new recruits in a safety belt around plantations (e.g. a 15-m wide belt could reduce recruitment in c. 95\%) while they can be easily uprooted (1\textendash 2years) and have not reached sexual maturity. Given the resistance of native forests to eucalypt establishment, fostering this type of vegetation in those belts would facilitate their maintenance and increase their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Tree plantations are an important cause of plant invasions worldwide, being a serious concern for biodiversity conservation. Pinus and Eucalyptus are the two most important genera for the forestry industry worldwide, with Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata among the most widespread and invasive. In this study we analyse the establishment of wildlings of these two species in native eucalypt forests (karri and jarrah forests) of SW Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. We selected boundaries between plantations and adjoining native forests (26 for E. globulus and 25 for P. radiata) and established in each a plot 100 m long (aligned to outer edge of forest) \texttimes{} 100 m or 50 m deep into the native forest (for boundaries with P. radiata and E. globulus plantations, respectively), that was thoroughly searched for wildlings. Eucalyptus globulus wildlings were only found in 3 of the 26 boundaries studied, 6 individuals in total, all within first 10 m from the forest edge. Pinus radiata wildlings were found in all boundaries and at all distances inspected. Wildling density was greater in jarrah forest compared to karri forest (mean 70.7 and 24.7 wildlings ha-1; respectively); it was negatively correlated with understorey cover (r = -0.501, F = 7.72, p = 0.011) and the density of older wildlings (20 + years) was positively correlated with time since plantation establishment (r = 0.512; F = 8.16; P = 0.009). Invasion of native eucalypt forests by alien E. globulus does not seem currently of concern in SW Australia. The scheduled short rotations (8\textendash 10 years), which means that trees are mostly harvested before reaching their full reproductive potential, lower dispersal ability than P. radiata and the customary establishment of cleared margins around plantations (10 m wide on average) all contribute to reduce the propagule pressure in native forests and with it the invasion potential. Nevertheless, attention should be paid to abandoned plantations left unharvested for longer, which may increase the invasion risks. In contrast, P. radiata plantations do constitute a threat to native vegetation for the invasion capacity of this species, as indicated by the presence of wildlings in all native forests studied, together with the relatively high density of old trees with high reproductive capacity in the forests interior. Awareness about wilding pine spread is urgently needed in SW Australia, in order to minimise the risks.},

  abstract = {Biological invasion by non-native tree species can transform landscapes, and as a consequence, has received growing attention from researchers and managers alike. This problem is driven primarily by the naturalisation and invasion of tree species escaping from cultivation or forestry plantations. Furthermore, these invasions can be strongly influenced by the land-use matrix of the surrounding region, specific management of the source populations, and environmental conditions that influence seed dispersal or habitat quality for the invader. A major unresolved challenge for managing tree invasions in landscapes is how management should be deployed to contain or slow the spread of invading populations from one or more sources (e.g. plantations). We develop a spatial simulation model to test: (1) how to best prioritise the control of invasive tree populations spatially to slow or contain the biological invader when habitat quality varies in the landscape, and (2) how to allocate control effort among different management units when trees spread from many source populations. We first show that to slow down spread effectively, management strategy is less important than management effort. We then identify the conditions affecting the relative performance of different management strategies. At the landscape scale, targeting peripheral stands consistently yielded the best results whereas at the regional scale, management strategies needed to account for both habitat quality and tree life-history. Overall, our findings demonstrate that knowledge of how habitat affects tree life-history stages can improve management to contain or slow tree invasions by improving the spatial match between management effort and efficacy.},

  abstract = {The role of plant diversity in reducing invasions has generated decades of debate. Diverse communities might be more resistant to invasion because the communities contain resident species that are functionally similar to the invader (limiting similarity), or multiple species use the range of available resources more effectively (complementarity) than single species. However, the correlation of native and exotic diversity often reverses, becoming positive, with increasing spatial and temporal scale, in a phenomenon called the invasion paradox. We addressed two groups of hypotheses related to this paradox, broadly that (1) functional diversity and identity resist invasion initially, via complementarity or limiting similarity; and (2) disturbance and propagule pressure weaken the effects of functional diversity and identity on invader success through time. Using long-term data from experimental serpentine grassland assemblages in California, we examined how the abundance of a high impact invader, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), related to functional diversity, functional dissimilarity, pocket gopher disturbance, and propagule pressure. We also conducted a single-season experiment in which we seeded disturbed and undisturbed areas and quantified invader success the following year. Neither diversity, nor dissimilarity, nor disturbance significantly impacted the success of C. solstitialis during the years of this study. Instead, propagule pressure was the single most important predictor of C. solstitialis abundance. We consolidated these findings into a novel conceptual model of invader success to illustrate how propagule input may outweigh community resistance through time, and what implications these dynamics have for the invasion paradox.},

Less is known, however, about how the structural attributes of adjacent rainforest (e.g. tree density, canopy cover and tree height) impact seed rain patterns into abandoned pastures. Between 2011 and 2013, we used seed traps and ground seed surveys to track the richness and abundance of rainforest seeds entering abandoned pastures in Australia's wet tropics. We also tested how seed rain diversity is related to the distance from forest, the proportion of forest cover in the landscape and several structural attributes of adjacent forest patches, specifically average tree height, canopy cover, tree species richness and density. Almost no seeds were captured in elevated pasture seed traps, even near forest remnants. Abundant forest seeds were found in ground surveys but only within 10 m of forest edges. In ground surveys, seeds from wind-dispersed species were more abundant, but less species rich, than animal-dispersed species. A survey of pasture seedling recruits suggested that some forest seeds must be dispersing more than 10 m into pasture at very low frequencies, but only a few species are establishing there. Recruits were predominantly animal-dispersed not wind-dispersed species. In addition to distance from forest and the proportion of forest within a 100- to 200-m radius of sampling sites, the richness and density of adjacent forest trees were the most important factors for explaining the probability of seed occurrence in abandoned pastures. Results suggest that without some restoration assistance, the recovery of abandoned pastures into secondary rainforest in Australia's tropical rainforests will likely be limited, at least in part, by a very low rate of seed dispersal away from forest edges and by the diversity and density of trees in adjacent remnant forests.},

  abstract = {1 Although invasions by alien plants are major threats to the biodiversity of natural habitats, individual habitats vary considerably in their susceptibility to invasion. Therefore the risk assessment procedures, which are used increasingly by environmental managers to inform effective planning of invasive plant control, require reliable quantitative information on the extent to which different habitats are susceptible to invasion. It is also important to know whether the levels of invasion in different habitats are locally specific or consistent among regions with contrasting climate, flora and history of human impact. 2 We compiled a database of 52 480 vegetation plots from three regions of Europe: Catalonia (Mediterranean\textendash submediterranean region), Czech Republic (subcontinental) and Great Britain (oceanic). We classified plant species into neophytes, archaeophytes and natives, and calculated the proportion of each group in 33 habitats described by the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) classification. 3 Of 545 alien species found in the plots, only eight occurred in all three regions. Despite this large difference in species composition, patterns of habitat invasions were highly consistent between regions. None or few aliens were found in environmentally extreme and nutrient-poor habitats, e.g. mires, heathlands and high-mountain grasslands. Many aliens were found in frequently disturbed habitats with fluctuating nutrient availability, e.g. in man-made habitats. Neophytes were also often found in coastal, littoral and riverine habitats. 4 Neophytes were found commonly in habitats also occupied by archaeophytes. Thus, the number of archaeophytes can be considered as a good predictor of the neophyte invasion risk. However, neophytes had stronger affinity to wet habitats and disturbed woody vegetation while archaeophytes tended to be more common in dry to mesic open habitats. 5 Synthesis and applications. The considerable inter-regional consistency of the habitat invasion patterns suggests that habitats can be used as a good predictor for the invasion risk assessment. This finding opens promising perspectives for the use of spatially explicit information on habitats, including scenarios of future land-use change, to identify the areas of highest risk of invasion.},

  abstract = {Habitats vary considerably in the level of invasion (number or proportion of alien plant species they contain), which depends on local habitat properties, propagule pressure, and climate. To determine the invasibility (susceptibility to invasions) of different habitats, it is necessary to factor out the effects of any confounding variables such as propagule pressure and climate on the level of invasion. We used 20 468 vegetation plots from 32 habitats in the Czech Republic to compare the invasibility of different habitats. Using regression trees, the proportion of alien plants, including archaeophytes (prehistoric to medieval invaders) and neophytes (recent invaders), was related to variables representing habitat properties, propagule pressure, and climate. The propagule pressure was expressed as the proportion of surrounding urban and industrial or agricultural land, human population density, distance from a river, and history of human colonization in the region. Urban and industrial land use had a positive effect on the proportion of both archaeophytes and neophytes. Agricultural land use, higher population density, and longer history of human impact positively affected the proportion of archaeophytes. Disturbed human-made habitats with herbaceous vegetation were most invaded by both groups of aliens. Neophytes were also relatively common in disturbed woody vegetation, such as broad-leaved plantations, forest clearings, and riverine scrub. These habitats also had the highest proportion of aliens after removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, indicating that they are not only the most invaded, but also most invasible. These habitats experience recurrent disturbances and are rich, at least temporarily, in available nutrients, which supports the hypothesis that fluctuating resources are the major cause of habitat invasibility. The least invaded habitats were mires and alpine-subalpine grasslands and scrub. After removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, some habitats actually invaded at an intermediate level had very low proportions of aliens. This indicates that these habitats (e.g., dry, wet, and saline grasslands, base-rich fens, and broad-leaved deciduous woodlands) are resistant to invasion.},

  abstract = {Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) covers extensive areas of the mountains of western North America. It has evolved into four subspecies, each adapted to slightly different environmental conditions. All are adapted to reproduce following fire. Subspecies latifolia is the most extensive and economically important in North America. Serotiny is common in this subspecies, but trees bearing nonserotinous cones can be found in most stands, sometimes constituting more that 70\% of the trees. Cone crops are produced yearly and seed loss to seed predators, insects and diseases are minimal. Germination and establishment occurs across a broad range of conditions allowing lodgepole pine to grow on poor sites as well as highly productive sites. These characteristics give lodgepole pine the ability to be highly invasive in new areas of suitable habitat.},

  abstract = {A critical question in invasion biology involves the relative importance of propagule rain and community invasibility. For plant invasions, invasibility is often related to disturbance, but few studies of forest invaders have simultaneously investigated both canopy and ground-level disturbance. We investigated the relative importance of seed rain, canopy disturbance, and soil disturbance in a mature forest in Maryland on the recruitment of four invasive species: wine raspberry (Rubus phoenicolasius Maxim.), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb.), and Japanese stiltgrass [Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus]. Using complete censuses of a 9-ha plot at two points in time (2011\textendash 12 and 2014), we mapped new recruits, and related their locations to canopy and soil disturbance, as well as to a seed rain index based on locations of reproducing plants and seed-dispersal kernels.We found that propagule rain, as measured by the seed rain index, was a significant predictor of recruitment for B. thunbergii, R. phoenicolasius, and M. vimineum. For R. multiflora, seed sources were not located, precluding assessment of propagule rain, but recruitment was linked to canopy disturbance, as was recruitment of M. vimineum. However, because reproduction of R. phoenicolasius and, in some years, of B. thunbergii is higher in treefall gaps, these gaps experience higher propagule rain, with the result that recruitment is indirectly associated with these gaps. Ground-layer disturbance was an important predictor of recruitment only for B. thunbergii. Our findings reveal that the importance of propagule rain is the most consistent driver of recruitment, but canopy or ground-layer disturbance promotes recruitment of some invasive plant species.},

These plantations now cover 565,000ha, mainly in the northern area. In this paper we summarize and discuss existing ecological knowledge of this species introduction. With regard to long-term sustainability we suggest management means to minimize harmful effects of the introduction on ecosystems. These include aspects of self dispersal, pests, ecosystem and landscape structures, and also ecological processes and biodiversity. We also focus on observed and possible interactions in the ecosystems. As Pinus contorta seeds are disseminated and trees regenerated outside initial plantations, this may have future bearings on biodiversity. We suggest a strategy which takes account of the uncertainty in predicting future ecological effects. The strategy includes areal restrictions and zones without Pinus contorta, but also to set up a monitoring program. Observations of adverse effects from the plantations would then give the possibility to adjust P. contorta management.},

  abstract = {The tree species used in planted forests are highly productive and have an important role in countries economy but the expansion of these trees into habitats outside plantations is a concern for managers and conservationists. Among the most planted forest species worldwide, we can find eucalypts and pines species. Understanding spatial patterns and the factors that influence these species colonization is crucial to increase the knowledge about expansion capability of these species and may help managers to improve and prioritize eventual control plans. Our study aimed to identify the recruitment spatial patterns of Pinus pinaster (native species) and Eucalyptus globulus (exotic species) into habitats surrounding plantations in Portugal (native forests, grasslands and shrublands) and to determine the factors that influence recruitment. This was done by looking at the recruitment success in several habitats near plantations, using a spatial gradient of distance to plantations edge. We observed as expected that the recruitment of P. pinaster and E. globulus decreased exponentially from the plantation edge. However, the higher P. pinaster seedling recruitment in this study (P. pinaster: 247 seedlings/ha; E. globulus: 22 seedlings/ha), the smallest decline in seedlings density with distance from plantation boundary (P. pinaster=-0.036seedlings/m vs E. globulus=-0.048seedlings/m), and the longer distance of seedling establishment, demonstrate clearly that P. pinaster is more successful colonizing the habitats near plantations than E. globulus. Nevertheless E. globulus can growth seedlings within the planted stands suggesting that the species is becoming naturalized. However, localized recruitment (92\% of the total seedlings recorded were located less than 15m from the plantation edge) and lower levels of establishment of E. globulus from managed plantations, suggested that this species did not demonstrate an invasive behavior. However, future research in abandoned eucalyptus plantation is needed to understand the role of plantation management and age as barriers to E. globulus colonization. Results from our survey revealed the suitability of all habitat types studied for P. pinaster natural regeneration, although their recruitment was more limited in forest habitat type. Forest and grassland were very resistant to E. globulus establishment. The two species recruitment was also influenced by different factors, with P. pinaster being independent of climatic variables, while E. globulus was affected by temperature seasonality and recruitment was found to be higher in areas with lower seasonal differences.},

We surveyed 50 E. globulus plantations across Portugal looking at the natural establishment (occurrence and density) of E. globulus in habitats adjacent to plantations. Eucalypts presence was only recorded in 8\% of the plots. Site characteristics (such as habitat type, vegetation cover and disturbance) were the most important variables influencing the natural recruitment of E. globulus in comparison to climate or plantation variables. Forest and grassland were the most resistant habitats to eucalyptus invasion while highly disturbed areas can be considered hubs for eucalypt density. The high importance of site characteristics reflects that most of the variability in eucalypt establishment occurs at small spatial scales. Thus, monitoring and management efforts should focus on those sites with higher establishment probability (i.e. open areas) trying to promote native vegetation and reduce disturbance levels.},

  abstract = {Pine invasion is a global threat that is occurring in native forests of diverse regions of the world. This process is arising in a scenario of rapid forest deforestation and degradation. Therefore, elucidate which forests attributes explain invasibility is a central issue in forest ecology. The Coastal Maulino forest is an endemic forest of central Chile, which has suffered a large history of disturbance, being replaced by large extensions of Pinus radiata plantations. This land transformation conveys high rates of pines invasion into native remnants. In this study we examined to what extent structural features of forest patches explains invasibility of this forest-type. Within eight forest fragments, we sampled 162 plots (10 x 10 m2 each). We quantified seedling pine density and related these estimates with tree cover, litter depth, PAR radiation, and diversity of the resident community. Our results indicate that canopy cover was the most important variable to determine seedling pine density within forest fragments. Our investigation highlights the importance to conserve the forests cover to reduce significantly their invasibility. This action can be effective even if we cannot avoid pine plantations in the region as a source of a massive seed dispersal to forests with well conserved canopy.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is an inherently spatial process that can be affected by habitat conditions in sites encountered by dispersers. Understanding landscape resistance to dispersal is important in connectivity studies and reserve design, but most existing methods use resistance functions with cost parameters that are subjectively chosen by the investigator. We develop an analytic approach allowing for direct estimation of resistance parameters that folds least cost path methods typically used in simulation approaches into a formal statistical model of dispersal distributions. The core of our model is a frequency distribution of dispersal distances expressed as least cost distance rather than Euclidean distance, and which includes terms for feature-specific costs to dispersal and sex (or other traits) of the disperser. The model requires only origin and settlement locations for multiple individuals, such as might be obtained from mark\textendash recapture studies or parentage analyses, and maps of the relevant habitat features. To evaluate whether the model can estimate parameters correctly, we fit our model to data from simulated dispersers in three kinds of landscapes (in which resistance of environmental variables was categorical, continuous with a patchy configuration, or continuous in a trend pattern). We found maximum likelihood estimators of resistance and individual trait parameters to be approximately unbiased with moderate sample sizes. We applied the model to a small grizzly bear dataset to demonstrate how this approach could be used when the primary interest is in the prediction of costs and found that estimates were consistent with expectations based on bear ecology. Our method has important practical applications for testing hypotheses about dispersal ecology and can be used to inform connectivity planning efforts, via the resistance estimates and confidence intervals, which can be used to create a data-driven resistance surface.},

The hindcast uses ERA-Interim as initial and boundary conditions and covers the period 1979\textendash 2017. The earlier NORA10 hindcast used ERA-40 as initial and boundary conditions before September 2002 and operational analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in the continuation. This change in initial and boundary conditions may lead to non-stationarities in bias and random errors, and it is a question of some concern whether this also leads to spurious trends. We investigate this by comparing the two hindcasts. We find only minor differences in the statistics of means and upper percentiles, but somewhat larger differences in the extremes (100-year return values) of significant wave height and 10-m winds. Generally, NORA10EI outperforms NORA10 in the ERA-40 period (before September 2002) since ERA-Interim outperforms ERA-40. Conversely, NORA10 outperforms NORA10EI after 2006, since the operational ECMWF analyses here outperform ERA-Interim. Years 2002\textendash 2006 is a transition period with minor differences between the NORA10 and NORA10EI where the resolution of ERA-Interim is lower than that of the ECMWF analyses, but its physics are from a more recent model (2006). An important finding is that the regional hindcasts appear quite insensitive to changes in the host reanalysis with no statistically significant differences in mean and upper percentile trends of wind speed and wave height. A comparison of four polar low cases confirms that using ERA-Interim as host reanalysis yields a slightly better representation of evolution and intensity of polar lows than NORA10 in the ERA-40 period and the opposite after 2006.},

  abstract = {Background Although a standard taxonomy of organisms has existed for nearly 300 years, no consensus has yet been reached on principles for systematization of ecological diversity (i.e., the co-ordinated variation of abiotic and biotic components of natural diversity). In a rapidly changing world, where nature is under constant pressure, standardized terms and methods for characterization of ecological diversity are urgently needed (e.g., to enhance precision and credibility of global change assessments). Aim The aim is to present the EcoSyst framework, a set of general principles and methods for systematization of natural diversity that simultaneously addresses biotic and abiotic variation, and to discuss perspectives opened by this framework. Innovation EcoSyst provides a framework for systematizing natural variation in a consistent manner across different levels of organization. At each ecodiversity level, EcoSyst principles can be used to establish: (a) an extensive attribute system with descriptive variables that cover all relevant sources of variation; (b) a hierarchical-type system; and (c) a set of guidelines for land-cover mapping that is consistent across spatial scales. EcoSyst type systems can be conceptualized as multidimensional models, by which a key characteristic (the response) is related to variation in one or more key sources of variation (predictors). EcoSyst type hierarchies are developed by a gradient-based iterative procedure, by which the ``ecodiversity distance'' (i.e., the extent to which the key characteristic differs between adjacent candidate types) is standardized and the ecological processes behind observed patterns are explicitly taken into account. Application We present ``Nature in Norway'' (NiN), an implementation of the EcoSyst framework for Norway for the ecosystem and landscape levels of ecodiversity. Examples of applications to research and management are given. Conclusion The EcoSyst framework provides a theoretical platform, principles and methods that can complement and enhance initiatives towards a global-scale systematics of ecodiversity.},

  abstract = {Aim To investigate the medium to long-distance dispersal abilities of temperate hardwood tree species and the ecological controls on dispersal, including distance to and connectivity with seed sources, seed source strength, and species dispersal mechanism and seed size. Location A fragmented forest system in the Long Point region, Southern Ontario. Methods Pine plantations were the `seed traps' in which seedlings of hardwood species were enumerated to indicate past dispersal events. The influence of distance to seed sources, dispersal mechanism and seed mass on the probability of dispersal to plantations were evaluated using logistic analysis. Regression analysis was used to determine the effect of seed source strength (mature tree abundance within 150 m of plantations) on seedling density in plantations. Connectivity was assessed by comparing the strength of correlations between seedling abundance in plantations and the abundance of mature trees around plantations in connected vs. unconnected source areas. Results Seedling presence in plantations decreased significantly with distance from the nearest potential seed source for species grouped according to dispersal mechanism. Probabilities of seedling presence were {$\geq$}0.8 at 25 m distances, decreasing to under 0.3 at 175 m distances. While twenty-seven of twenty-nine species were present in at least one plantation with a seed source within 25 m, only thirteen of twenty-seven species occurred in plantations with a seed source {$\geq$}100 m away, and only nine of twenty-four species in plantations {$\geq$}150 m from seed sources, indicating limited potentials for interfragment migration. Seed source strength was significantly related to seedling density in plantations for twelve of fifteen species tested, indicating the importance of species commonness to interfragment migration. Connectivity was not related to dispersal frequency in the system, but this finding applies to a relatively well-connected system of forests and plantations and is expected to differ for systems with greater patch isolation. In addition to these general controls, dispersal was related to species dispersal mechanism. Seed size was negatively related to dispersal frequency, but only within the rodent dispersal spectra. Bird-dispersed species appeared to have superior interfragment dispersal abilities, closely followed by lighter seeded rodent- and wind-dispersed species. Large-seeded rodent-dispersed species (Juglans spp., Quercus macrocarpa) and species lacking well-developed adaptations for dispersers were infrequent in plantations generally, and with the exception of Q. macrocarpa, were absent from plantations more than 50 m from seed sources. Species dispersal abilities were ranked according to dispersal mechanism and seed size such that: bird {$>$} lighter-seeded rodent = wind {$>$} larger-seeded rodent = unspecialized. Main conclusions Distance to seed sources appears to be a key determinant of patch colonization. Infrequent dispersal over distances of {$>$}100\textendash 150 m for most species in this system raises concerns about the abilities of tree species to be sustained in fragmented forests. For some species, distances of as little as 50 m appear to be isolating, and these, in particular, risk regional extinctions over time scales depending on their local population persistence. Artificial introductions may be needed to maintain fragmented tree populations, particularly for rare species and those with poor dispersal indicated in this study.},

  abstract = {Models and observational studies have sought patterns of predictability for invasion of natural areas by nonindigenous species, but with limited success. In a field experiment using forest understory plants, we jointly manipulated three hypothesized determinants of biological invasion outcome: resident diversity, physical disturbance and abiotic conditions, and propagule pressure. The foremost constraints on net habitat invasibility were the number of propagules that arrived at a site and naturally varying resident plant density. The physical environment (flooding regime) and the number of established resident species had negligible impact on habitat invasibility as compared to propagule pressure, despite manipulations that forced a significant reduction in resident richness, and a gradient in flooding from no flooding to annual flooding. This is the first experimental study to demonstrate the primacy of propagule pressure as a determinant of habitat invasibility in comparison with other candidate controlling factors.},

  abstract = {A numerical model (TurbSeed) is described which calculates explicitly the dispersal of plant seeds by wind, especially the fraction of seeds, which are transported more than 100m starting at the inflorescence. Such rare events are called here long-distance dispersal. The framework of TurbSeed includes three main modules:(1)A turbulence model (TM) for a specified location and time period using meteorological parameters from publicly available mesoscale weather models or simulated climate data.(2)A Lagrangian model (LM) which calculates the seed transport in the turbulent boundary layer and(3)A module which considers the effect of weather conditions on release of seeds (RS). In this approach the turbulent field is prescribed by a coarse wind field derived from the mesoscale climate simulations superimposed by a random velocity component. Similar approaches are known as Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian approaches. The main difference in this new approach (TM) lies in the construction of the turbulent structure of the wind field. The introduction of such a random velocity component uses the Monin\textendash Obukhov similarity theory. An inverse random phase Fast-Fourier-Transformation reconstructs the time structure of turbulence using a parameterized power spectrum of turbulence which is accepted as standard in micro meteorology. In the LM module Monte-Carlo-Simulations for numerous trajectories are used to incorporate the effects of turbulence. The RS module takes into account various conditions of release of plant seeds, such as the date of maturity of the seeds and the effect of wind speed on the release of seeds. This model can be driven not only with data from observed weather conditions, but also with output of mesoscale climate scenarios. Thus, TurbSeed can study the effect of climate change on wind dispersal of seeds.},

  abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km2. Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km2. Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m \texttimes{} 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.},

Even though the tree has mostly serotine cones, adapted to open after forest fires, it has proved able to self-regenerate in Sweden. This study is the first to present, scientifically, the extent of self-regeneration covering the whole current range of LP-forests in Sweden. LP-saplings were recorded for three years, 2015\textendash 2017, in 8194 subplots distributed over 214 randomly selected LP-stands from latitude 59.6\textendash 66.9\textdegree N and altitude 88\textendash 710~m asl. Of all subplots, 3\% contained LP-saplings, and regeneration was found in 53\% of all stands. The probability of finding LP-saplings was significantly dependent on the plots' distance from the edge of the LP-stand, and 78\% of all saplings were found within and up to 15~m beyond the stand edge. Most, 63\%, of the plots with LP were found on disturbed ground such as wheel tracks, roadsides and where there had been site preparation. The results show that LP can naturally spread under a range of conditions in the studied region. The regeneration is, however, concentrated in particular stands and should be possible to control with monitoring programmes and measures to eradicate self-dispersed trees in unwanted areas.},

Because we find that the fits to count data of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions are often similar, to understand their differences, we compare the probability mass functions and skewnesses of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions with the first two moments fixed. They have slight differences in many situations, but their zero-inflated distributions, with masses at zero, means and variances fixed, can differ more. These probabilistic comparisons are helpful in selecting a better fitting distribution for modelling count data with long right tails. Through a real example of count data with large zero fraction, we illustrate how the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions as well as their zero-inflated distributions can be discriminated.

The aim of this study was to determine the variations in the basic physical properties of seeds of selected spruce species and to identify the correlations between these attributes for the needs of the seed sorting processes. Terminal velocity, thickness, width, length, mass, and the angle of external friction were determined in the seeds of 11 spruce species. The measured parameters were used to calculate three aspect ratios (geometric mean diameter, sphericity index, and specific mass) of each seed. The average values of the basic physical properties of the analyzed seeds were determined in the following range: terminal velocity\&mdash;5.25 to 8.34 m s\&minus;1, thickness\&mdash;1.10 to 2.32 mm, width\&mdash;1.43 to 3.19 mm, length\&mdash;2.76 to 5.52 mm, the angle of external friction\&mdash;23.1 to 30.0\&deg;, and mass\&mdash;2.29 to 18.57 mg. The seeds of Jezo spruce and Meyer\&rsquo;s spruce were most similar to the seeds of other spruce species, whereas oriental spruce seeds differed most considerably from the remaining seeds. Our findings indicate that spruce seeds should be sorted primarily with the use of mesh sieves with longitudinal openings to obtain fractions with similar seed mass and to promote even germination.},

The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979-2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

A major knowledge gap in seed dispersal modeling by wind is the role of complex topography in modifying the kernel shape when referenced to the flat-world case. How complex topography modifies the dispersal kernels of inertial particles such as seeds is explored here via novel flume experiments. A train of gentle cosine hills and a canopy composed of densely arrayed rods with a roughness density resembling the leaf area density profile of hardwood species at maximum leaf area were used to represent a canopy-hill system. Spherical inertial particles having a coefficient of variation in terminal velocity commensurate with values reported from field studies were employed as model seeds. It was demonstrated that the seed dispersal kernel maintained its canonical `Wald' form as derived from simplified turbulent dispersion theories for flat terrain and vertically uniform flow field. Seeds released near the canopy top and from the top of the hill have a dispersal kernel mean distance that was about 35\% times larger than its counterpart for releases from the bottom of the hill. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, defined here as seeds traversing a longitudinal distance exceeding 10 times the canopy height, were one order of magnitude larger for seeds released near the canopy top and from the hill top when compared to their counterpart released from the hill bottom.},

Also, we determine the proportions of a specific landscape in Sweden that are at varying distances from lodgepole pine and the degree to which landscape fragmentation may be increased by lodgepole pine plantations. The results indicate that all portions of the study area could receive wind-dispersed seed from existing lodgepole pine plantations, but that the level of additional fragmentation introduced by lodgepole pine in an already highly fragmented landscape is low. In general, however, the effects of forest fragmentation are compounded when the regeneration of native species is replaced by plantations of introduced species because new patch types are introduced. Even if the exotic species develop a forest structure similar to that produced by native species, a different kind of fragmentation \textemdash{} species fragmentation \textemdash{} is created that persists much longer than if only native species are involved. The ecological effects of introducing lodgepole pine, with a tree structure very similar to that of the native Scots pine, cannot yet be predicted with confidence, but managers should be cautious about creating new plantations in landscapes where there is a desire to avoid the invasion of an exotic species. Some research priorities are identified.},

  abstract = {Alien conifer invasions are affecting ecosystems across the globe, but until recently, reports of such invasions in South America were scarce. Pinus contorta was first established in Chilean Patagonia for erosion control caused by historical fires and cattle farming. Recently, the species has been planted over large areas for commercial purposes. It is well adapted to local conditions and is now spreading into natural areas. This study analyzes natural regeneration of Pinus contorta around Coyhaique city, Chile, to determine the spatial patterns of invasion. Five study sites were selected, four with grasslands dominated by exotic species and one site in the steppe. In each site, the plantation (seed source) was characterized using morphological attributes and density. Regeneration, density, height and age at different distances from the seed source were recorded, and ground cover was measured as an environmental factor influencing the invasion process. A comparative analysis was also conducted between the situation in Chile and other countries affected by P. contorta invasion. In Chile, P. contorta regeneration is significantly influenced by distance from the seed source. Higher densities are found close to the parent stand (up to 13,222 trees ha-1), decreasing as distance from the seed source increases. Age and height structure indicate that the invasion process is at an early stage, and this offers a unique opportunity to study the process of invasion and to monitor it over time. In order to preserve the distinctiveness of Patagonian ecosystem, decisive action is required to control invasive conifers, with P. contorta as the number one priority. Relative to control, there is much that can be learnt from the experiences of other countries, such as New Zealand.},

What are the spatio-temporal processes involved in pine invasions in contrasting Mediterranean and semi-arid climatic regions? Location: Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel. Methods: The density of invading Pinus was measured in relation to the distance from the plantation edge. Plants were categorized by age, height, basal stem girth and developmental stage, their spatial distribution was also recorded. Results: Analysis of plant age distribution indicates that the invasion process started when the plantations were 20\textendash 25 years old. Most invading plants were found within 20 m from the plantation edge, but a few individuals reached distances up to 100 m and became new invasion foci. Plant density declined sharply with distance from adult trees, data showing a better fit to a power model than to a negative exponential model. Invading Pinus began to produce cones earlier in the semi-arid than in the Mediterranean region (9 vs 12 years to 50\% reproductive plants). In both regions, higher densities of invading plants were found on the west side of the plantation, the opposite direction to the hot winds that prevail during seed release. Conclusion: The frontal advance of P. halepensis from plantations is relatively slow, but the populations also expand by a saltation process, creating spreading `islands' of pine trees in the natural vegetation. Spatial pattern of recruits with distance from the source population was remarkably similar to the pattern of seed dispersal in the same region (Nathan et al. 1999). This implies that the probability of a dispersed seed developing into a plant is independent of the distance from the forest edge.},

  abstract = {With a simple model, I show that comparisons of invasibility between regions are impossible to make unless one can control for all of the variables besides invasibility that influence exotic richness, including the rates of immigration of species and the characteristics of the invading species themselves. Using data from the literature for 184 sites around the world, I found that nature reserves had one-half of the exotic fraction of sites outside reserves, and island sites had nearly three times the exotic fraction of mainland sites. However, the exotic fraction and the number of exotics were also dependent on site area, and this had to be taken into account to make valid comparisons between sites. The number of native species was used as a surrogate for site area and habitat diversity. Nearly 70\% of the variation in the number of exotic species was accounted for by a multiple regression containing the following predictors: the number of native species, whether the site was an island or on the mainland, and whether or not it was a nature reserve. After controlling for scale, there were significant differences among biomes, but not continents, in their level of invasion. Multiple biome regions and temperate agricultural or urban sites were among the most invaded biomes, and deserts and savannas were among the least. However, there was considerable within-group variation in the mean degree of invasion. Scale-controlled analysis also showed that the New World is significantly more invaded than the Old World, but only when site native richness (probably a surrogate for habitat diversity) is factored out. Contrary to expectation, communities richer in native species had more, not fewer, exotics. For mainland sites, the degree of invasion increased with latitude, but there was no such relationship for islands. Although islands are more invaded than mainland sites, this is apparently not because of low native species richness, as the islands in this data set were no less rich in native species than were mainland sites of similar area. The number of exotic species in nature reserves increases with the number of visitors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about relative invasibility, invasion potential, or the roles of dispersal and disturbance from any of these results. Most of the observed patterns here and in the literature could potentially be explained by differences between regions in species properties, ecosystem properties, or propagule pressure.},

To fill this gap, we followed the fates of 2,552 individual seedlings for 12 years after a large-scale bark-beetle outbreak that caused complete canopy dieback in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southeast Germany. We explore the contribution of advance, disturbance-related, and post-disturbance regeneration to forest recovery. Most seedlings originated directly within the three-year dieback of canopy trees induced by bark-beetle outbreak. After complete canopy dieback, the establishment of new seedlings was minimal. Surprisingly, advance regeneration formed only a minor part of all regeneration. However, because it had the highest survival rate, its importance increased over time. The most important factor influencing the survival of seedlings after disturbance was their height. Survival was further modified by microsite: seedlings established on dead wood survived best, whereas almost all seedlings surrounded by graminoids died. For 5 cm tall seedlings, annual mortality ranged from 20 to 50\% according to the rooting microsite. However, for seedlings taller than 50 cm, annual mortality was below 5\% at all microsites. While microsite modified seedling mortality, it did not affect seedling height growth. A model of regeneration dynamics based on short-term observations accurately predicts regeneration height growth, but substantially underestimates mortality rate, thus predicting more surviving seedlings than were observed. We found that P. abies forests were able to regenerate naturally even after severe bark-beetle outbreaks owing to advance and particularly disturbance-related regeneration. This, together with microsite-specific mortality, yields structurally and spatially diverse forests. Our study thus highlights the so far unrecognized importance of disturbance-related regeneration for stand recovery after bark-beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are a key intervention for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. A major challenge for PAs is the control of invasive non-native plants that spread into PAs from surrounding sources such as forestry plantations. The links between invasions and different source populations are poorly understood, making it difficult to apportion responsibilities for control costs. We estimated the effect of plantations of invasive pines (Pinus species) on the spread of these trees into PAs in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR). We assessed the effect of (i) distance from plantation, (ii) plantation and PA orientation in relation to the prevailing wind and (iii) the proportionate size of the surrounding plantation on the abundance of invasions in PAs. We also estimated the historic and potential future costs of controlling invasions in the PAs. PA management units within 3 km of a plantation had over double the pine cover of control units {$>$}6 km from plantations (6{$\cdot$}12\% vs. 2{$\cdot$}39\%). We attributed 51\% of the pine invasions in PAs to plantations. Neither the proportional size of the plantations nor their orientation relative to prevailing winds had a detectable effect on the cover of invasive pines. Costs of controlling invasive pines in the study area totalled 98 million Rand (10 Rand = c. 1 US\$ in 2013) between 2001 and 2012. It could cost between 273 and 916 million Rand (all future costs expressed in 2013 Rand), and take between 34 and 113 years, to clear the remaining invasive pines in the study area, depending on rates of spread and the cost\textendash effectiveness of control. Policy implications. Estimating the contribution of an invasion source, in this case forestry plantations, requires estimating an unobservable counterfactual outcome: the invasions that would have occurred in the absence of the plantations. We have made a first step towards doing this by using empirical approaches that vary in the strictness of their assumptions, along with robustness tests to that assess the plausibility of these assumptions. Our study provides the starting point for estimating the contribution of plantation forestry to protected area invasions in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.},

  abstract = {Understanding biological invasions patterns and mechanisms is highly needed for forecasting and managing these processes and their negative impacts. At small scales, ecological processes driving plant invasions are expected to produce a spatially explicit pattern driven by propagule pressure and local ground heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the interplay between the intensity of seed rain, using distance to a mature plantation as a proxy, and microsite heterogeneity in the spreading of Pinus contorta in the treeless Patagonian steppe. Three one-hectare plots were located under different degrees of P. contorta invasion (Coyhaique Alto, 45\textdegree{} 30{${'}$}S and 71\textdegree{} 42{${'}$}W). We fitted three types of inhomogeneous Poisson models to each pine plot in an attempt for describing the observed pattern as accurately as possible: the ``dispersal'' models, ``local ground heterogeneity'' models, and ``combined'' models, using both types of covariates. To include the temporal axis in the invasion process, we analyzed both the pattern of young and old recruits and also of all recruits together. As hypothesized, the spatial patterns of recruited pines showed coarse scale heterogeneity. Early pine invasion spatial patterns in our Patagonian steppe site is not different from expectations of inhomogeneous Poisson processes taking into consideration a linear and negative dependency of pine recruit intensity on the distance to afforestations. Models including ground-cover predictors were able to describe the point pattern process only in a couple of cases but never better than dispersal models. This finding concurs with the idea that early invasions depend more on seed pressure than on the biotic and abiotic relationships seed and seedlings establish at the microsite scale. Our results show that without a timely and active management, P. contorta will invade the Patagonian steppe independently of the local ground-cover conditions.},

The numbers of invasive alien species \textendash{} the subset of alien species that spread widely in areas where they are not native, affecting the environment or human livelihoods \textendash{} are increasing. Synergies with other global changes are exacerbating current invasions and facilitating new ones, thereby escalating the extent and impacts of invaders. Invasions have complex and often immense long-term direct and indirect impacts. In many cases, such impacts become apparent or problematic only when invaders are well established and have large ranges. Invasive alien species break down biogeographic realms, affect native species richness and abundance, increase the risk of native species extinction, affect the genetic composition of native populations, change native animal behaviour, alter phylogenetic diversity across communities, and modify trophic networks. Many invasive alien species also change ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services by altering nutrient and contaminant cycling, hydrology, habitat structure, and disturbance regimes. These biodiversity and ecosystem impacts are accelerating and will increase further in the future. Scientific evidence has identified policy strategies to reduce future invasions, but these strategies are often insufficiently implemented. For some nations, notably Australia and New Zealand, biosecurity has become a national priority. There have been long-term successes, such as eradication of rats and cats on increasingly large islands and biological control of weeds across continental areas. However, in many countries, invasions receive little attention. Improved international cooperation is crucial to reduce the impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human livelihoods. Countries can strengthen their biosecurity regulations to implement and enforce more effective management strategies that should also address other global changes that interact with invasions.},

The dynamic atmospheric downscaling is performed as a series of short prognostic runs initialized from a blend of ERA-40 and the previous prognostic run to preserve the fine-scale surface features from the high-resolution model while maintaining the large-scale synoptic field from ERA-40. The nested WAM wave model hindcast consists of a coarse 50 km model covering the North Atlantic forced with ERA-40 winds and a nested 10\textendash 11 km resolution model forced with downscaled winds. A comparison against in situ and satellite observations of wind and sea state reveals significant improvement in mean values and upper percentiles of wind vectors and the significant wave height over ERA-40. Improvement is also found in the mean wave period. ERA-40 is biased low in wind speed and significant wave height, a bias which is not reproduced by the downscaling. The atmospheric downscaling also reproduces polar lows, which cannot be resolved by ERA-40, but the lows are too weak and short-lived as the downscaling is not capable of capturing their full life cycle.},

Factors determining naturalization in plants 388 Acknowledgements 392 References 392 Summary The literature on biological invasions is biased in favour of invasive species \textendash{} those that spread and often reach high abundance following introduction by humans. It is, however, also important to understand previous stages in the introduction\textendash naturalization\textendash invasion continuum (`the continuum'), especially the factors that mediate naturalization. The emphasis on invasiveness is partly because most invasions are only recognized once species occupy large adventive ranges or start to spread. Also, many studies lump all alien species, and fail to separate introduced, naturalized and invasive populations and species. These biases impede our ability to elucidate the full suite of drivers of invasion and to predict invasion dynamics, because different factors mediate progression along different sections of the continuum. A better understanding of the determinants of naturalization is important because all naturalized species are potential invaders. Processes leading to naturalization act differently in different regions and global biogeographical patterns of plant invasions result from the interaction of population-biological, macroecological and human-induced factors. We explore what is known about how determinants of naturalization in plants interact at various scales, and how their importance varies along the continuum. Research that is explicitly linked to particular stages of the continuum can generate new information that is appropriate for improving the management of biological invasions if, for example, potentially invasive species are identified before they exert an impact.},

  abstract = {Many factors interact to determine whether an introduced organism will become invasive. The widespread planting of many Pinus species at various densities and in many habitats at different times in the Southern Hemisphere (well outside their natural range) provides a unique opportunity to identify the determinants of invasive success for a large group of related organisms. At least sixteen pine species have spread from planting sites to invade natural or semi-natural vegetation. Species with adventive populations over fairly large areas are P. contorta Dougl., P. halepensis Mill., P. patula Schiede \& Deppe, P. pinaster Ait., P. ponderosa Laws., P. radiata D. Don and P. sylvestris L. This paper explores the biological profiles of successful invaders, the inherent and induced susceptibility of different vegetation types to invasion, patterns of invasion, the role of disturbance in initiating and sustaining invasions, the role of time, and the various functions of the resident biota in the receiving habitat in mediating the outcome of an introduction. This information, with evidence from contemporary studies of pine dynamics in the Northern Hemisphere and reconstructions of pine migrations in the early Holocene, shows that: (1) Most of the important invaders share a suite of biological traits that facilitate long-distance dispersal by wind, and allow invading populations to persist in habitats subjected to frequent disturbance. (2) The extent of invasion for widely planted species is positively correlated with the residence period. (3) Ground-cover categories can be ranked according to their vulnerability to invasion as follows: forest {$<$} shrubland {$<$} grassland {$<<$} dunes {$<$} bare ground. (4) Distribance regimes and the resident biota have a marked (and complex) influence on invadability. This information is used to predict future trends in pine invasions.},

The role of propagule pressure relative to disturbance and various environmental factors is, however, difficult to quantify. We explored the relative importance of factors driving invasions using detailed data on the distribution and percentage cover of alien tree species on South Africa's Agulhas Plain (2,160 km2). Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster). A semimechanistic model was then developed to quantify the roles of propagule pressure and environmental heterogeneity in structuring invasion patterns. The intensity of propagule pressure (approximated by the distance from putative invasion foci) was a much better predictor of canopy cover than any environmental factor that was considered. The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors. The mediating effect of environmental factors was species specific. Models combining propagule pressure and environmental factors successfully predicted more than 70\% of the variation in canopy cover for each species.},

  abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Seed dispersal distance-a key process in plant population dynamics-remains poorly understood because of the difficulty of finding a source plant so well isolated from conspecifics that seeds or seedlings can be unambiguously attributed to it. Inverse modeling (IM) of seed dispersal, a simple statistical technique for parameterizing dispersal kernels, has been widely used since 1992; surprisingly, however, this approach has never been verified in the field. METHODS: We released from 20 nearby trees the winged seeds of a liana species, Entada polystachya, near the coast in a tropical, dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. KEY RESULTS: With a two-parameter log-normal function, we found that IM predicted both the shape and scale parameters well as long as we used the entire data set. When, however, we subsampled (thus simulating the use of transects for seedlings or an array of seed traps), the estimates of the scale and shape parameters were often more than double the real values. The problem was due to the marked anisotropy (directional bias; in this case, in the direction of the diurnal sea breeze) of the individual dispersal curves. When we randomized the direction of dispersal of individual seeds from the trees (keeping dispersal distances unchanged), predictions of parameter values were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Inverse modeling must include directional parameters when dealing with areas where strong anisotropy is to be expected, e.g., for wind dispersal of seeds near coasts or pollination by any vector where a plant species is limited to a strongly linear habitat such as river banks.},

The set of criteria consists of three criteria that quantify invasion potential, and six criteria that capture the ecological effects of alien species. The threshold values for all criteria are numerically defined, rendering the set of criteria fully quantitative. Genericity is ensured by using criteria that are applicable to all taxonomic groups and in all habitats. In being generic, quantitative, ecological and normatively neutral, the criteria were inspired by the international Red List criteria. Capturing both invasion potential and effect, GEIAA can be regarded as a full ecological impact assessment. The assessment procedure contains guidelines on documentation, the collection of background information, the handling of uncertainty, and quality assurance. GEIAA represents the second revision, and thus the third generation, of assessment methodology in Norway. It has recently been used to carry out more than 2500 impact assessments of alien species in Norway and Sweden.},

  abstract = {Effective seed dispersal, combining both dispersal and postdispersal (establishment) processes, determines population dynamics and colonization ability in plants. According to the Janzen\textendash Connell (JC) model, high mortality near the mother plant shifts the offspring establishment distribution farther away from the mother plant relative to the seed dispersal distribution. Yet, extending this prediction to the distribution of mature (reproductive) offspring remains a challenge for long-living plants. To address this challenge, we selected an isolated natural Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) population in Mt. Pithulim (Israel), which expanded from five ancestor trees in the beginning of the 20th century into {$\sim$}2000 trees today. Using nine microsatellite markers, we assigned parents to trees established during the early stages of population expansion. To elucidate the effect of the distance from the mother plant on postdispersal survival, we compared the effective seed dispersal kernel, based on the distribution of mother\textendash offspring distances, with the seed dispersal kernel, based on simulations of a mechanistic wind dispersal model. We found that the mode of the effective dispersal kernel is shifted farther away than the mode of the seed dispersal kernel, reflecting increased survival with increasing distance from the mother plant. The parentage analysis demonstrated a highly skewed reproductive success and a strong directionality in effective dispersal corresponding to the wind regime. We thus provide compelling evidence that JC effects act also on offspring that become reproductive and persist as adults for many decades, a key requirement in assessing the role of postdispersal processes in shaping population and community dynamics.},

Locations R\'io Negro province, Argentina; Ays\'en and Araucan\'ia regions, Chile; South Island (two ecoregions), New Zealand; Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, USA. Methods We quantified tree abundance and size across invasion fronts of the widespread invasive tree species Pinus contorta at each of the nine sites, encompassing both the native and introduced range. We also determined the relative importance of propagule pressure, abiotic characteristics and biotic factors for invasion success. Finally, key plant population metrics such as individual tree growth rates and reproductive effort were compared between native and introduced ranges. Results Pinus contorta density decreased with increasing distance from source population in all cases, but the importance and shape of this relationship differed among sites due, primarily to biotic factors. For example, areas dominated by native southern beech forest (Fuscospora cliffortioides or Nothofagus spp.) were not invaded, and this biotic resistance was not overcome by high propagule pressure. In contrast, shrublands were more highly invaded than grasslands, contradicting previous generalizations about pine invasions. Pinus contorta growth was faster, age to maturity was earlier and reproductive effort was higher in the introduced ranges compared with the native range, suggesting a demographic shift towards more rapid population growth in introduced regions. Climatic differences between the ranges may explain, at least in part, the observed pattern. Main conclusions We demonstrate that although biological invasions are driven by propagule pressure across different ecoregions, these processes interact strongly with biotic factors. Intriguingly, our results suggest that propagule pressure may become less important than biotic interactions as invasions proceed. Multi-region studies including both the native and introduced ranges provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding how these interactions change among regions as invasions proceed.},

In order to better understand how tree species' distributions may change in response to anticipated climate change, more knowledge of the effects of complex climate and biotic interactions is needed. We conducted a seed-sowing experiment to investigate how temperature, precipitation and biotic interactions impact recruitment of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings in southern Norway. Seeds were sown into intact vegetation and experimentally created gaps. To study the combined effects of temperature and precipitation, the experiment was replicated across 12 sites, spanning a natural climate gradient from boreal to alpine and from sub-continental to oceanic. Seedling emergence and survival were assessed 12 and 16~months after sowing, respectively, and above-ground biomass and height were determined at the end of the experiment. Interestingly, very few seedlings were detected in the boreal sites, and the highest number of seedlings emerged and established in the alpine sites, indicating that low temperature did not limit seedling recruitment. Site precipitation had an overall positive effect on seedling recruitment, especially at intermediate precipitation levels. Seedling emergence, establishment and biomass were higher in gap plots compared to intact vegetation at all temperature levels. These results suggest that biotic interactions in the form of competition may be more important than temperature as a limiting factor for tree seedling recruitment in the sub- and low-alpine zone of southern Norway.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal is the main movement mechanism used by plants. The last decade saw rapid progress in understanding the underlying processes, especially for dispersal by wind, in part due to new mechanistic modeling approaches that account for turbulent fluctuations. Yet, current wind dispersal models stop short of explicitly incorporating the effects of landscape topography on the main transporting vector \textendash{} wind, so that the effects of wind variability over hills on dispersal patterns remain by and large unstudied. A new mechanistic model was developed that combines Eulerian wind statistics derived from a simplified analytical approach of flow over gently sloped forested hills with a Lagrangian seed trajectory model. Model runs were used to explore the effects of seed release location along the hill on dispersal kernels predicted by the new model in relation to their flat-terrain counterparts. The model was parameterized for a Pinus taeda plantation, and a range of seed motion capacities represented by terminal velocity and release height, and realistic topographic variation were then explored. To evaluate model performance, computed kernels were compared to kernel measurements collected in a large flume for spherical `seeds' released near the top of a rod canopy covering gentle cosine hills. The evaluation showed that the model reproduced the key experimental differences in dispersal patterns for releases at the hill crest and bottom. The simulations revealed several novel findings. For seeds released within the canopy, both median and 99th percentile dispersal distances on the hill upwind side were up to two times longer than on flat terrain for the same motion capacity. Seeds released on the lee side traveled mostly toward the hill crest \textendash{} following the local within-the-canopy wind direction. This direction was contrary to the `regional' wind direction set by the flow conditions above the canopy. There, the directionality of the long-distance dispersal was additionally dependent on uplifting probability, affected by seed motion capacity. It was demonstrated that neglecting the effects of even gentle topography in mechanistic seed dispersal models can lead to biased estimates of dispersal distances and directionality on hilly terrain. These results are pertinent to plant population demography, connectivity and spread on hills. More broadly, the approach developed here can be extended to movement of pollen and various airborne organisms over hills.},

It has been widely planted over many decades in the Perth region of southwest Australia. Here we used plots to measure the density, size and approximate age of P. pinaster wildings in native vegetation adjacent to pine plantations and in areas of cleared plantations. Results demonstrated that densities of P. pinaster wildings were highest at edges and varied widely with vegetation type, being much greater in dense, wetland vegetation compared to more open sclerophyllous woodlands, which was contrary to that experienced in other regions. Wilding regeneration following clearing was also highly variable. Local populations of black cockatoos, which fell cones to ground for feeding, are likely to have contributed to low levels of spread into native bushland by curtailing wind dispersal of seeds from tree canopies, as well as providing an ample seed source for regeneration of wildings at cleared sites. Wildfires, which can lead to mass regeneration of P. pinaster elsewhere, did not promote spread of wildings into adjoining bushland, but did enhance wilding densities in wetland vegetation within the plantation matrix.},

Alien trees can simultaneously bring many benefits and cause substantial environmental harm, very often leading to conflicts over how they should be managed. The impacts grow over time as invasions spread, and societal perceptions of the value of alien trees also change as understanding grows and as values shift. This leads to a dynamic environment in which trade-offs are required to maximise benefits and minimise harm. The management of alien tree populations needs to be strategic and adaptive, combining all possible management interventions to promote the sustainable delivery of optimal outcomes. We use examples, mainly from South Africa (where issues relating to invasive alien trees introduced for forestry have received most attention), to argue for holistic and collaborative approaches to alien tree management. Such approaches need to include bold steps, such as phasing out unsustainable plantation forestry that is based on highly invasive species, and in which the costs are externalised. Furthermore, it would be advisable to impose much stricter controls on the introduction of alien trees to new environments, so that problems that would arise from subsequent invasions can be avoided.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms behind population and community responses to edge effects. However, functional responses remain poorly explored. Seed dispersal is a key process in ecosystem functioning, and edge effects may alter patterns of seed dispersal through changes in dispersers' behavior and environmental conditions. Here, we test predictive models of edge effects and habitat suitability on seed dispersal by considering different scenarios given by differences in the dispersal agent (wind and vertebrate dispersal), and the contrast between habitats of native southern Atlantic forest and tree plantations that occur across the entire area of influence of the edge. We fit our data to non-linear theoretical models to explore the response of seed rain to three general patterns of response to edge effects and differences on habitat suitability: (1) monotonic (sigmoid or exponential) (seed rain is higher in one of the habitats), (2) unimodal (seed rain shows either a maximum or a minimum near the edge, with or without differences on habitat suitability between adjacent habitats) and (3) neutral response (seed rain is constant across the ecotone). We estimated abundance and richness of wind- and vertebrate-dispersed seeds using seed traps, and measured vegetation structure in four different edges between native forest and tree plantations (from recent to mature plantations). Edge effects affected seed rain patterns depending on both the degree of vegetation contrast between habitats and the dispersal agent. Wind-dispersed seeds showed a monotonic response to most edges, whereas responses of vertebrate-dispersed seeds varied among edges (monotonic, unimodal and neutral), consistent with the dispersers' behavior. High contrast edges (forest-recent plantation) showed unimodal edge response, while those created by low contrast edges (forest-mature plantation) exhibited monotonic responses (sigmoid). Differences on habitat suitability on vertebrate-dispersed seeds increased with edge contrast, while richness and abundance of vertebrate-dispersed seeds in the habitat interior showed the opposite pattern. The abundance of wind-dispersed seeds inside the studied habitats increased with edge contrast. The current analytical framework developed to explore responses of populations and communities to edge effects successfully described the response of seed dispersal. Furthermore, edge effects affected seed dispersal patterns differently depending on the dispersal agent and the contrast between habitats. Our findings contribute to the understanding of forest regeneration processes and may help increase the effectiveness of restoration efforts.},

In the present study, we examined functional patterns of seed dispersal between the native forest and tree plantations with different degrees of contrast. We expected that the movement of seeds between the native forest and plantations would depend on the degree of edge contrast, the dispersal syndrome, and the size/weight of seeds. We sampled the seed rain by using seed traps, and measured vegetation structure in the ecotone between four different plantations and the native forest (300 m inside both the native forest and the plantations) in the Atlantic forest of Argentina during a 12-month period. We weighed wind-dispersed seeds and measured vertebrate-dispersed seeds. Edge effects acted as a filter for seed size/weight of both vertebrate- and wind-dispersed seeds. The abundance and functional diversity of seeds arriving at tree plantations increased with plantation age; large seeds were more sensitive to habitat disturbance than small seeds, independently of the dispersal syndrome. Our results highlight that seed movements between the native forest and human-created habitats largely depend on the interaction between dispersal syndrome, seed size, distance to the edge and habitat contrast. Our results also showed that long-term plantation cycles will increase the functional diversity of seeds in the seed bank and facilitate the regeneration of the native vegetation, and that small mature stands close to the native forest will largely facilitate the arrival of seeds and increase the suitability for native fauna.},

As a result, sampling probability is geographically uneven, which may confound the model's characterization of the species' distribution. Modelers frequently address sampling bias by manipulating training data: either subsampling presence data or creating a similar spatial bias in non-presence background data. We tested a new method, which we call `background thickening', in the latter category. Background thickening entails concentrating background locations around presence locations in proportion to presence location density. We compared background thickening to two established sampling bias correction methods \textendash{} target group background selection and presence thinning \textendash{} using simulated data and data from a case study. In the case study, background thickening and presence thinning performed similarly well, both producing better model discrimination than target group background selection, and better model calibration than models without correction. In the simulation, background thickening performed better than presence thinning when the number of simulated presence locations was low, and vice versa. We discuss drawbacks to target group background selection, why background thickening and presence thinning are conservative but robust sampling bias correction methods, and why background thickening is better than presence thinning for small sample sizes.

  abstract = {Selective pressures that influence the form of seed dispersal syndromes are poorly understood. Morphology of plant propagules is often used to infer the means of dispersal, but morphology can be misleading. Several species of pines, for example, have winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal but owe much of their establishment to scatter-hoarding animals. Here the relative importance of wind vs. animal dispersal is assessed for four species of pines of the eastern Sierra Nevada that have winged seeds but differed in seed size: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta murrayana, 8 mg); ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa ponderosa, 56 mg); Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi, 160 mg); and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana, 231 mg). Pre-dispersal seed mortality eliminated much of the ponderosa pine seed crop (66\%), but had much less effect on Jeffrey pine (32\% of seeds destroyed), lodgepole pine (29\%), and sugar pine (7\%). When cones opened most filled seeds were dispersed by wind. Animals removed {$>$}99\% of wind-dispersed Jeffrey and sugar pine seeds from the ground within 60 days, but animals gathered only 93\% of lodgepole pine seeds and 38\% of ponderosa pine seeds during the same period. Animals gathered and scatter hoarded radioactively labeled ponderosa, Jeffrey, and sugar pine seeds, making a total of 2103 caches over three years of study. Only three lodgepole pine caches were found. Caches typically contained 1\textendash 4 seeds buried 5\textendash 20 mm deep, depths suitable for seedling emergence. Although Jeffrey and sugar pine seeds are initially wind dispersed, nearly all seedlings arise from animal caches. Lodgepole pine is almost exclusively wind dispersed, with animals acting as seed predators. Animals treated ponderosa pine in an intermediate fashion. Two-phased dispersal of large, winged pine seeds appears adaptive; initial wind dispersal helps to minimize pre-dispersal seed mortality whereas scatter hoarding by animals places seeds in sites with a higher probability of seedling establishment.},

  abstract = {Most species introductions are not expected to result in invasion, and species that are invasive in one area are frequently not invasive in others. However, cases of introduced organisms that failed to invade are reported in many instances as anecdotes or are simply ignored. In this analysis, we aimed to find common characteristics between non-invasive populations of known invasive species and evaluated how the study of failed invasions can contribute to research on biological invasions. We found intraspecific variation in invasion success and several recurring explanations for why non-native species fail to invade; these included low propagule pressure, abiotic resistance, biotic resistance, genetic constraints and mutualist release. Furthermore, we identified key research topics where ignoring failed invasions could produce misleading results; these include studies on historical factors associated with invasions, distribution models of invasive species, the effect of species traits on invasiveness, genetic effects, biotic resistance and habitat invasibility. In conclusion, we found failed invasions can provide fundamental information on the relative importance of factors determining invasions and might be a key component of several research topics. Therefore, our analysis suggests that more specific and detailed studies on invasion failures are necessary.},
